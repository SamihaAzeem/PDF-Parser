Title: Effectiveness of using information technology in higher education, PDF: Research_papers_50\1-s2.0-S1877042812014164-main.pdf
Header: Abstract 
Information technology (IT) refers to personal electronic devices such as laptops and handheld computers, smart phones, and 
institutions computers and associated devices.  This study investigates the usefulness, efficiency and efficacy  of information 
technology in higher education in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  The study was conducted in the College of Education, King 
Saud University.  The survey was distributed among 161 female  college students selected randomly from a pool of 400 female 
students  who  were  attending  different  courses  in  different  areas.    Results  indicated  that  61.5%  of  the  participants  used  the 
electronic device in their course activities and 65.8% used IT for blogging.   Interestingly, 72% of participants are often doing 
online shopping and 88.6% of the students are often creating read, send e-mail and instant messages.  A number of issues arising 
from this study were included in the conclusion and implications.

Header: Introduction 
Information  technology  (IT)  refers  to  an  integrated  framework  of  computers,  software  applications,  multimedia 
content, the Internet, web-based applications, learning management systems (e.g. IVLE) and other tools that can be 
used to enhance the teaching and learning process.  The benefits of using IT in teaching are supported by research 
and literature also integrating IT into the curriculum as it helps to improve the quality of teaching and learning.  The 
subject  of  IT  tops  the  agenda  of  almost  every  college  and  university  today  because  of  the  expectations  of  a 
technologically  advancing  society  and  because  aggressive  IT  utilization  is  seen  as  an  indicator  of  a  progressive 
institution (Milligan, 2010;Shanon et al(2009); Caruso,J.B. et al 2007). 
The rapid information technology (IT) advances have extended to all aspects of  business including the accounting 
profession.  The impacts of the dynamic nature of IT on accounting practices force accounting education to reform 
its programmes in order to keep pace with changes in the profession.  IT skills have become another mandatory skill 
for  practising  accountants  (Bouchard,  2005;  Kepczyk,  2005)  besides  other  generic  skills  such  as  leadership  skill, 
communication skill and general business knowledge (Robert Half International Inc., 2003). The Issue of integrating 
IT  skills  in  accounting  education  has  been  a  continuing  concern  for  many  parties  including  professionals, 
educational  bodies  as  well  as  accounting  educators  all  over  the  world  (AAA,  1986;AECC,  1990;IFAC,  1995a, 
2003;Salleh, 2000;Chang and Hwang, 2003; Ahmed, 2003, Lin et al, 2005; Jones and Abraham, 2007). 
Academics  and  professional  organizations  have  called  for  IT  competent  graduates  and  have  voiced  concern  over 
whether  accounting  education  can  effectively  and  efficiently  prepare  accountants  to  meet  the  challenges  (AAA, 
1986; AECC, 1990; Dearing, 1997:Lyons, 1997; Boritz, 1999; Stoner, 1999; Albrecht and Sack, 2000; IFAC, 1995,

2003;Howieson, 2003;Chang and Hwang, 2003;Lin et al. 2005; Jones and Abraham, 2007).  They acknowledge the 
need for greater development of higher level transferable skills including IT skills in accounting programmes. 
                 Researchers,  business  leaders,  professional,  educators  as  well  as  academic  organizations  have  made 
rigorous initiatives and efforts to strengthen IT integration in accounting education.  These include (but not limited 
to)  Bhaskar,  (1982;1983),  Er  and  Ng,  (1989),  Collier  et  al.,  (1990),  Crawford  and  Barr,  (1998)  and  Salleh, 
(2000)who  discuss  alterative  uses  of  the  computer  in  accounting  education.    Besides,  there  are  professional 
accounting  bodies  and  academic  organizations  such  as  BAA-SIG  accounting  education,  BAAEC  ,  Dearing 
(1997)IFAC(1995,2003) and QAA(2000a,2000b,2000c) that encourage and provide some guidance to integrate IT 
in  accounting  programmes.  For  example  Dearing  (1997)  recommends  establishing  the  Professional  Institute  of 
Learning and Teaching in Higher Education which has among its functions a leading role in assisting institutions to 
exploit the potential of communications and information technology  for learning and teaching.  Last but not least, 
there are some educators (these include) Marriot, 1992; Marriot et al., 1999; Sangster, 1992, 1995a, 1995b; Sangster 
and  Mulligan,  1997;  Larres  and  Radcliffe,  2000;  Larres  et  al.,(  2003)  who  report  on  their  actual  experience  in 
integrating IT into their taught accounting units. 

IT with its new technologies serves a number of functions.  Brown (2000) refers to these functions as that 

digital and information form.  In the field 
of  education,  IT  is  commonly  seen  as  how  computers  and  the  Internet  can  best  be  harnessed  to  improve  the 
efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  process  of  teaching  and  learning  (Guha,  2003).    It  can  have  a  transformative 
effect  on educational systems because it is a potentially powerful tool for extending educational opportunities and 
greatly facilitate the acquisition and absorption of knowledge (Conlon & Simpson, 2003) with the use of computers.  
It  tends  to  redefine  teacher  and  student roles  and  beliefs  about  teaching and  learning  (Guha,  2003).    The  teacher 
becomes a coach and collaborator rather than a dispenser of knowledge  with the implementation of computer use 
into schools. 

This  paper describes and analyzes trends in the information technologies and the impact these have on the 
education  sector  as  a  whole,  but  particularly  on  the  higher  education  sector.    These  technologies  can  be  used  to 
address the changing demands within the sector: 

For more flexible learning. 
For extension of university services to national and international markets; and  
For more cost-effective delivery of higher education in an increasingly competitive environment. 

The growing use of information technologies in education is part of a wider technological revolution, evidenced 

in: 
The increasing use of computers and the Internet in Saudi Arabia. 
The growth of the on-line economy within Saudi Arabia. 
The Increasing competition in communication services.  
The broader public policy environment regarding the learning society and the use of educational technology.

Header: 3.LITERATURE REVIEW: 
The need for IT competency development in undergraduate accounting education is acknowledged in the 
literature  by  accounting  educators  and  practitioners,  as  is  mentioned  in  the  background  to  the  study  in  the 
introduction section. This includes among others Albrecht and Sack, 2000; Ahmed, 2003; Howieson, 2003; Chang 
and Hwang, 2003; Lin et. al. 2005; Jones and Abraham,  2007.  Most of the studies were informed by a quantitative 
approach  based  on  survey  data  except  Albrecht  and  Sack  (2000),  which  complements  the  survey  data  with 
interviews.    Basically,  they  investigate the  extent to  which the  IT  skills  as  outlined  by  (Albrecht and  Sack,  2000; 
Howieson, 2003; Chang and Hwang, 2003; Lin et al. 2005; Jones and Abraham, 2007) and IFAC/IEG-11 (Ahmed, 
2003), are developed in the accounting programmes in various countries such as USA  (Albrecht & Sack,2000;Cang 
& Hwang, 2003 ), China (Lin et. al., 2005), UK (Ahmed, 2003) and Egypt (Ahmed, 2003).  While the studies reveal 
the degree of the IT skills development relative to the guidelines, they  fail to discover other important issues like 

 
 
 
 
1270  

 Fahad N. Alfahad  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   46  ( 2012 )  1268  1278 

approaches  used  to  develop  the  skills,  awareness  of  educators  on  the  guidelines, and  the reason  of  developing as 
well as not developing the skills. 

What IT competencies are and how they should be developed in undergraduate studies are two important 
questions  to  be  explored  in  order  to  ensure  a  successful  implementation  of  developping  IT  competencies  in 
accounting graduates.  The subsequent subsections review literature on guidelines on IT skills development, possible 
ways of developing IT skills and issues in implementing them and key success and failure factors. 

Kvavik and Caruso (2005) found  that students actually support a moderate amount of technology in their 
courses.    They  also  reported  that  students  have  lower  skill  levels  in  course-related  technologies,  such  as  using 
specialized  software,  or  a  course  management  system,  such  as  Blackboard.    Therefore,  assessing  the  level  of 
Information  Technology  (IT)  literacy  on  a  given  campus  is  important  in  making  decisions  regarding  technology 
incorporation into curriculum and other future campus-wide investments in technology resources (Tyler, 2005). 

Even though, technology is more available for instructors now than ever before, many of them are resistant 
to incorporating technology into their classrooms.  Cuban (1999) states that professors and students at the university 
level have grown comfortable with e-mail and Web pages, but less than 10 percent of faculty use these technologies 
for teaching.  However, even those instructors who embrace technology still find barriers that inhibit its use in the 
classroom.  In a study  by  Brill and Galloway (2007), two limitations to the use  of technology in instruction were 
noted: inadequate availability of technology, and classrooms that do not adequately support technology.  Ultimately, 
the decision to use technology is up to the instructor.  While the examples above illustrate some of the barriers to the 

to use technology in the classroom. 

Fortunately,  previous  research  on  IT  provides  some  valuable  insights.    Various  factors  such  as  feelings, 
beliefs,  attitudes  and  perceptions  have  emerged  from  the  literature  as  inputs  into  the  decision  whether  or  not  to 
ty  and  can  be 
confusing.  However, when broken into two categories, internal and external factor trends emerge that make them 
more understandable.

technology  in 
teaching are  individual  beliefs  (Albion  &  Ertmer,  2002),  feelings  and  anxiety  (Dusik,2000),fears,  preferences  and 
perceptions(  Grasha  &Yangabar-Hicks,2000)  and  feelings  of  competence  (Dusik,  2000).    Kane,  through  her 
assessment of available 

incorporate  new  pedagogy  into  teaching  is 
have previously learned.  Given this, one can extrapolate that if an instructor has a positive attitude or orientation 
towards technology, he will be more inclined to incorporate it into his teaching. 

Another way beliefs influence the decision whether or not to integrate technology is the view the instructor 
has towards various teaching practices and styles.  Grasha and Hicks (2000, p.3) found that teaching styles are based 
ds, emotions, motives, beliefs, and attitudes of the teacher and that these teaching practices, when used 

teacher's  decisions  to  integrate  technology  into  instruction  are  based  on  their  teaching  styles  and  strategies.  

-wave  (self-
starters), second-wave (traditionalists), third-wave (careerists), and fourth-wave (reluctants).  The personal beliefs of 
each  group  encourage  or  hinder  the  use  of  technology  in  instruction.    For  example,  fourth-wave  instructors 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fahad N. Alfahad  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   46  ( 2012 )  1268  1278 

1271

(reluctants)  are  not  enthusiastic  when  it  involves  technology  integration  because  this  group  believes  in  the 
-centered and repetitious model of learning 

(Ferguson, 2004, p.136). 

These  beliefs  which  are  to  group  faculty  members  are  often  developed  early  in  their  academic  career.  

about using technology while they are in school themselves, or after they begin their teaching careers, efforts should 
be made to improve their interaction with technology early in their careers. 

Competency,  another  internal  factor  that  determines  faculty  use  of  technology,  is  critical  in  making 

achers 

not feel well prepared are those who have been in the field for ten or more years.  This group may be reluctant to 
incorporate technology because they lack the technology skills needed.  This lack of skills is due mainly not having 
been  trained  or  not  having  been  technology  modeled  during  their  early  academic  career  (Rosenfeld  &  Martinez-
Pons,  2005).    Bandura  and  Schunk  (as  cited  in  Ertm

(p.33). 

Rovai and Childress (2003) found that computer apprehension or anxiety is related to psychological factors 
which can be helped with the right instruction, they suggest that those who take courses  which build self-efficacy 
and expand their knowledge of computers minimize the anxiety they feel towards integrating technology into actual 
classroom situations.  Christensen (2002) further reports technology anxiety may be reduced if faculty members are 
taken through training which offers several stages of adoption.  It is through these adoption stages that instructors 
increase their confidence and competency levels while integrating technology into coursework. 

ncies  and  comfort  with technology,  there 
should  be  a  stronger  likelihood  that  they  will  integrate  technology  successfully  into  their  classes.  However,  the 
internal  variables  discussed  above  are  only  half  of  the  story.    To  fully  understand  the  issues  surrounding  faculty

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 3.2  EXTERNAL FACTORS: 
External  factors  include  faculty  demographics,  specifically  age  and  gender,  class  size  and  institutional 
support.  Demographics such as age and gender may be primary factors that determine whether faculty members use 
technology  (Cooper,  2006,  p.331).    In  their  study,  Peluchette  and  Rust,  (2005)  state  that  at  the  university  level, 
faculty who are in the middle of their ca
to  competitive  pressures,  revise  programs  to  meet  the  needs  of  increasingly  diverse  students,  and  integrate  new 
 as to why this may be true.  First of all, tenured 
faculty may not be compelled or motivated to use technology.  Secondly, older or senior faculty members may not 
have the knowledge or training to use technology.  This leads to competency issues for older or tenured faculty. 

Another demographic factor is gender differences.  According to Spots (1997), male faculty members tend 
to rate their knowledge and use of technology higher than their female counterparts.  However, female instructors 
take factors such as lack of time and lack of professional advancement into consideration when deciding whether or 
not to integrate technology into the curriculum.  Additionally, Lumpe and Chambers (2001) posit from their study 
that female instructors are more likely to believe that external factors, such as administrators, students, equipment, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1272  

 Fahad N. Alfahad  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   46  ( 2012 )  1268  1278 

According  to  Pleuchette  and  Rust  (2005),  another  external  factor,  namely    class  size,  can  negatively 
influence technology use.  When faculty members use technologies such as email and chat rooms, larger classes can 
be difficult to manage, especially when teaching an online course.  According to Kelly and Maushak (2004) there is 
no  answer  to  the  question  of  what  the  ideal  class  size  is,  as  subject  matter  as  well  as  the  types  of  assignments 
instructors use are factors to take into consideration when integrating technology into the curriculum. 

Institutional  support,  the  final  external  factor  reviewed,  encompasses  a  wide  range  of  topics  including 
faculty development, ease of access for faculty members who wish to use technology, policies and procedures and 
support  for  technological  issues.    Osika  (2006)  argues    successful  technology  programs  require  support  from  the 

engaged with supporting instructional technology, especially online technologies, are those institutions that include 
technology support in their long-term strategic plans. 

It  is  clear  that  successfully  incorporating  technology  as  well  as  distance  learning  programs  into  the 
curriculum is a complex issue facing institutions of higher learning.  This issue is complicated further by the various 
factors which influence instructor's use of information technology in a classroom setting. 

This  survey  focuses  on  the  undergraduate  student's,  experiences  with  and  opinions  about  information 
technology.  The primary goal of the study is to better understand student experiences with information technology, 

associated devices.

Header: 5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The primary goal of the study was to have a better understanding of student experiences with information 
technology (IT), which, in turn, can help school's leadership to respond to the IT needs.  Tables 1 and 2 shows the 
percentage  of  the  descriptive  statistics 
technology. 

61.5% of these surveyed or 99 out of the 161 participants (weekly/ several time per week), have used the electronic 
device  in  their  course  activities,  while  13.7%  of  the  remaining  students  stated  that  they    only  use  the  electronic 
devices once per semester.

Survey  respondents  (monthly,  weekly),  often  use  an  electronic  device  to  get  access  to  a  library  resource 
(Q.2, (74 %), and a large number of students use IT for  blogging  (daily/ weekly),  (86.9 %) or 140 out of the 161 
participants (Q.9). 

Interestingly,  72%,  116  participants  out  of  the  161  are  often  doing  online  shopping  (Q.8),  (once  per 

semester /Monthly). 

We  found  that  the  majority  (87.6%)  of  the  students  or  141  students  often  create,  read,  send  e-mail  and 

instant messages (daily / weekly) (Q.5).

59% or 95 students are using the electronic devices once per semester/monthly. 

However,  52.2%  or  84  students  often  use  the  electronic  devices  for  writing  documents  for  course  work 
(Q.4) (weekly/ several times per week).  Only 10.6% or 17 out of 161  of the remaining participants are using the 
devices daily. 

When  students  were  asked  "how  often  do  you  create  web  pages?  (Q.13);  52.8%  or  85  out  of  161 

participants said they created web pages (once per semester) and only 7.5% or 12 students created web pages daily. 

49.1%  or  79  students  often  access  a  course  managements  system  (Q.14%) (Once  per  semester)  and  only 

5% or 8 students out of 161 participants  access a course   managements daily. 

Regarding  the  use  of  electronic  devices  for  creating  presentations  (Q.12);  only  5%  or  8  students  of  the  
participants  were  creating  presentations  daily.    Meanwhile  52%  or  84  students  created  presentation  (once  per 
semester/monthly). 

Respondents used the electronic device many times daily and doing online activities, for university, work 
and recreation.  The most frequent times used daily (18.26%) a total of (53.33%) times per week.  There are also 
those who spent (26.27%) times per semester, and (20.39%) times monthly using the electronic device. 

Respondents  were  quite  diverse  in  how  they  spent  their  time  using  technology.    E-mail  and  writing 
documents for courses have become ubiquitous; the majority of  respondent use e-mail daily and write documents, 
for their courses at least several times per week.  The use of university or college library Web site is not far behind. 

However, Table 3, gives the results of extracted communalities of all the variables.  It shows the proportion 
of the variance of a variable explained by the common factors.  From Table 3,it is very clear that "how often do you 
use an electronic device as an in-class requirement?" Q.3 has the least percentage ((30.0%) of variance that can be 
predicted  or  explained  by  other  13  variables.    On  the  other  hand,  "how  often  do  you  use  an  electronic  device  for

Another  statistical  analysis  instrument  is  the  reliability  coefficient,  Cronbach's  Alpha  (Cronbach,  1951) 

used to estimate the scale of consistency among items in the group (Hair et al. 1998).   

Cronbach's  Alpha  was  used  to  determine  the  internal  consistency  of  each  scale  in  this  research.    A 
Cronbach's  Alpha  coefficient is  close  to  1.0  means that  the  questions are  measuring  similar  dimensions  of  factor.  
Although the general limit is 0.7, score 0.6 would be acceptable because of the exploratory nature of this research.  
By  this  standard,  any  factor  with  Cronbach's  Alpha  coefficient  less  than  0.6  should  be  eliminated.    Table  4, 
illustrates the factors extracted from factor analysis and the Chronbach's alpha for reliability analysis of data.

Factor  analysis  led  14  questionnaire  statements.    As  a  result  of  the  reliability  analysis,  two  of  the  three 
factors  received  Cronbach's  alpha  coefficient  greater  than  0.6,  which  indicate    that  those  two  factors  should  be 
accepted. 

The internal consistency represented by coefficient Alpha, of all items is as much as 0.7510.  It reports the 
existence of cohesive internal relationships of all measurements in representing the information technology used and 
this result provides confidence that statistical results produced are coming from a stable measurement source. 

The first component represents the most contributory elements to the use of information technology.  Alpha 
value of this factor is 0.7310 representing internal consistency of this component.  The Alpha value of the Second 
factor is 0.6200, which is very low owing to the very limited number items (3 items).  The Alpha value of the third 
factory is 0.3370, which is very low owing to the very limited number of items (2 items). 

Factor analysis led fourteen questionnaire statements into three components 1-5, 9, 11-13; 6, 7, 10 and 8, 
14, form factors 1, 2 and 3 respectively (Table 4).  These factors contribute to the explanation in student information 
technology variable (49.27%) of total variance. 

The first component represents the most influential element on IT at a figure of 24.55% of total variance 
explained.    It  signifies  the  group  of  items  measuring  use  of  IT  for  course  activity,  library  resources,  in-class 
requirement, writing documents for coursework, e-mail, blogging, creating spread sheets (excel, etc.), presentations 
(power point, etc.) and creating web pages.  This tells us that the respondents perceived the items in this group as 
one factor.  Alpha value of this factor was 0.7310 representing a high internal consistency of this component. 

IT could be explained by the second factor, 14.49% of the total variance in this study.  The items under this 
group depict the use of IT in playing computer games, web-based music or videos and participation in online social 
networks  (face  book,  you  tube,  and  .com  etc.).    The  result  shows  that  respondents  perceived  all  types  of

Title: Effectiveness of using information technology in higher education, PDF: Research_papers_50\1-s2.0-S1877042812014164-main.pdf
Header: Abstract 
Information technology (IT) refers to personal electronic devices such as laptops and handheld computers, smart phones, and 
institutions computers and associated devices.  This study investigates the usefulness, efficiency and efficacy  of information 
technology in higher education in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  The study was conducted in the College of Education, King 
Saud University.  The survey was distributed among 161 female  college students selected randomly from a pool of 400 female 
students  who  were  attending  different  courses  in  different  areas.    Results  indicated  that  61.5%  of  the  participants  used  the 
electronic device in their course activities and 65.8% used IT for blogging.   Interestingly, 72% of participants are often doing 
online shopping and 88.6% of the students are often creating read, send e-mail and instant messages.  A number of issues arising 
from this study were included in the conclusion and implications.

Header: Introduction 
Information  technology  (IT)  refers  to  an  integrated  framework  of  computers,  software  applications,  multimedia 
content, the Internet, web-based applications, learning management systems (e.g. IVLE) and other tools that can be 
used to enhance the teaching and learning process.  The benefits of using IT in teaching are supported by research 
and literature also integrating IT into the curriculum as it helps to improve the quality of teaching and learning.  The 
subject  of  IT  tops  the  agenda  of  almost  every  college  and  university  today  because  of  the  expectations  of  a 
technologically  advancing  society  and  because  aggressive  IT  utilization  is  seen  as  an  indicator  of  a  progressive 
institution (Milligan, 2010;Shanon et al(2009); Caruso,J.B. et al 2007). 
The rapid information technology (IT) advances have extended to all aspects of  business including the accounting 
profession.  The impacts of the dynamic nature of IT on accounting practices force accounting education to reform 
its programmes in order to keep pace with changes in the profession.  IT skills have become another mandatory skill 
for  practising  accountants  (Bouchard,  2005;  Kepczyk,  2005)  besides  other  generic  skills  such  as  leadership  skill, 
communication skill and general business knowledge (Robert Half International Inc., 2003). The Issue of integrating 
IT  skills  in  accounting  education  has  been  a  continuing  concern  for  many  parties  including  professionals, 
educational  bodies  as  well  as  accounting  educators  all  over  the  world  (AAA,  1986;AECC,  1990;IFAC,  1995a, 
2003;Salleh, 2000;Chang and Hwang, 2003; Ahmed, 2003, Lin et al, 2005; Jones and Abraham, 2007). 
Academics  and  professional  organizations  have  called  for  IT  competent  graduates  and  have  voiced  concern  over 
whether  accounting  education  can  effectively  and  efficiently  prepare  accountants  to  meet  the  challenges  (AAA, 
1986; AECC, 1990; Dearing, 1997:Lyons, 1997; Boritz, 1999; Stoner, 1999; Albrecht and Sack, 2000; IFAC, 1995,

2003;Howieson, 2003;Chang and Hwang, 2003;Lin et al. 2005; Jones and Abraham, 2007).  They acknowledge the 
need for greater development of higher level transferable skills including IT skills in accounting programmes. 
                 Researchers,  business  leaders,  professional,  educators  as  well  as  academic  organizations  have  made 
rigorous initiatives and efforts to strengthen IT integration in accounting education.  These include (but not limited 
to)  Bhaskar,  (1982;1983),  Er  and  Ng,  (1989),  Collier  et  al.,  (1990),  Crawford  and  Barr,  (1998)  and  Salleh, 
(2000)who  discuss  alterative  uses  of  the  computer  in  accounting  education.    Besides,  there  are  professional 
accounting  bodies  and  academic  organizations  such  as  BAA-SIG  accounting  education,  BAAEC  ,  Dearing 
(1997)IFAC(1995,2003) and QAA(2000a,2000b,2000c) that encourage and provide some guidance to integrate IT 
in  accounting  programmes.  For  example  Dearing  (1997)  recommends  establishing  the  Professional  Institute  of 
Learning and Teaching in Higher Education which has among its functions a leading role in assisting institutions to 
exploit the potential of communications and information technology  for learning and teaching.  Last but not least, 
there are some educators (these include) Marriot, 1992; Marriot et al., 1999; Sangster, 1992, 1995a, 1995b; Sangster 
and  Mulligan,  1997;  Larres  and  Radcliffe,  2000;  Larres  et  al.,(  2003)  who  report  on  their  actual  experience  in 
integrating IT into their taught accounting units. 

IT with its new technologies serves a number of functions.  Brown (2000) refers to these functions as that 

digital and information form.  In the field 
of  education,  IT  is  commonly  seen  as  how  computers  and  the  Internet  can  best  be  harnessed  to  improve  the 
efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  process  of  teaching  and  learning  (Guha,  2003).    It  can  have  a  transformative 
effect  on educational systems because it is a potentially powerful tool for extending educational opportunities and 
greatly facilitate the acquisition and absorption of knowledge (Conlon & Simpson, 2003) with the use of computers.  
It  tends  to  redefine  teacher  and  student roles  and  beliefs  about  teaching and  learning  (Guha,  2003).    The  teacher 
becomes a coach and collaborator rather than a dispenser of knowledge  with the implementation of computer use 
into schools. 

This  paper describes and analyzes trends in the information technologies and the impact these have on the 
education  sector  as  a  whole,  but  particularly  on  the  higher  education  sector.    These  technologies  can  be  used  to 
address the changing demands within the sector: 

For more flexible learning. 
For extension of university services to national and international markets; and  
For more cost-effective delivery of higher education in an increasingly competitive environment. 

The growing use of information technologies in education is part of a wider technological revolution, evidenced 

in: 
The increasing use of computers and the Internet in Saudi Arabia. 
The growth of the on-line economy within Saudi Arabia. 
The Increasing competition in communication services.  
The broader public policy environment regarding the learning society and the use of educational technology.

Header: 3.LITERATURE REVIEW: 
The need for IT competency development in undergraduate accounting education is acknowledged in the 
literature  by  accounting  educators  and  practitioners,  as  is  mentioned  in  the  background  to  the  study  in  the 
introduction section. This includes among others Albrecht and Sack, 2000; Ahmed, 2003; Howieson, 2003; Chang 
and Hwang, 2003; Lin et. al. 2005; Jones and Abraham,  2007.  Most of the studies were informed by a quantitative 
approach  based  on  survey  data  except  Albrecht  and  Sack  (2000),  which  complements  the  survey  data  with 
interviews.    Basically,  they  investigate the  extent to  which the  IT  skills  as  outlined  by  (Albrecht and  Sack,  2000; 
Howieson, 2003; Chang and Hwang, 2003; Lin et al. 2005; Jones and Abraham, 2007) and IFAC/IEG-11 (Ahmed, 
2003), are developed in the accounting programmes in various countries such as USA  (Albrecht & Sack,2000;Cang 
& Hwang, 2003 ), China (Lin et. al., 2005), UK (Ahmed, 2003) and Egypt (Ahmed, 2003).  While the studies reveal 
the degree of the IT skills development relative to the guidelines, they  fail to discover other important issues like 

 
 
 
 
1270

approaches  used  to  develop  the  skills,  awareness  of  educators  on  the  guidelines, and  the reason  of  developing as 
well as not developing the skills. 

What IT competencies are and how they should be developed in undergraduate studies are two important 
questions  to  be  explored  in  order  to  ensure  a  successful  implementation  of  developping  IT  competencies  in 
accounting graduates.  The subsequent subsections review literature on guidelines on IT skills development, possible 
ways of developing IT skills and issues in implementing them and key success and failure factors. 

Kvavik and Caruso (2005) found  that students actually support a moderate amount of technology in their 
courses.    They  also  reported  that  students  have  lower  skill  levels  in  course-related  technologies,  such  as  using 
specialized  software,  or  a  course  management  system,  such  as  Blackboard.    Therefore,  assessing  the  level  of 
Information  Technology  (IT)  literacy  on  a  given  campus  is  important  in  making  decisions  regarding  technology 
incorporation into curriculum and other future campus-wide investments in technology resources (Tyler, 2005). 

Even though, technology is more available for instructors now than ever before, many of them are resistant 
to incorporating technology into their classrooms.  Cuban (1999) states that professors and students at the university 
level have grown comfortable with e-mail and Web pages, but less than 10 percent of faculty use these technologies 
for teaching.  However, even those instructors who embrace technology still find barriers that inhibit its use in the 
classroom.  In a study  by  Brill and Galloway (2007), two limitations to the use  of technology in instruction were 
noted: inadequate availability of technology, and classrooms that do not adequately support technology.  Ultimately, 
the decision to use technology is up to the instructor.  While the examples above illustrate some of the barriers to the 

to use technology in the classroom. 

Fortunately,  previous  research  on  IT  provides  some  valuable  insights.    Various  factors  such  as  feelings, 
beliefs,  attitudes  and  perceptions  have  emerged  from  the  literature  as  inputs  into  the  decision  whether  or  not  to 
ty  and  can  be 
confusing.  However, when broken into two categories, internal and external factor trends emerge that make them 
more understandable.

technology  in 
teaching are  individual  beliefs  (Albion  &  Ertmer,  2002),  feelings  and  anxiety  (Dusik,2000),fears,  preferences  and 
perceptions(  Grasha  &Yangabar-Hicks,2000)  and  feelings  of  competence  (Dusik,  2000).    Kane,  through  her 
assessment of available 

incorporate  new  pedagogy  into  teaching  is 
have previously learned.  Given this, one can extrapolate that if an instructor has a positive attitude or orientation 
towards technology, he will be more inclined to incorporate it into his teaching. 

Another way beliefs influence the decision whether or not to integrate technology is the view the instructor 
has towards various teaching practices and styles.  Grasha and Hicks (2000, p.3) found that teaching styles are based 
ds, emotions, motives, beliefs, and attitudes of the teacher and that these teaching practices, when used 

teacher's  decisions  to  integrate  technology  into  instruction  are  based  on  their  teaching  styles  and  strategies.  

-wave  (self-
starters), second-wave (traditionalists), third-wave (careerists), and fourth-wave (reluctants).  The personal beliefs of 
each  group  encourage  or  hinder  the  use  of  technology  in  instruction.    For  example,  fourth-wave  instructors 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fahad N. Alfahad  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   46  ( 2012 )  1268  1278

(reluctants)  are  not  enthusiastic  when  it  involves  technology  integration  because  this  group  believes  in  the 
-centered and repetitious model of learning 

(Ferguson, 2004, p.136). 

These  beliefs  which  are  to  group  faculty  members  are  often  developed  early  in  their  academic  career.  

about using technology while they are in school themselves, or after they begin their teaching careers, efforts should 
be made to improve their interaction with technology early in their careers. 

Competency,  another  internal  factor  that  determines  faculty  use  of  technology,  is  critical  in  making 

achers 

not feel well prepared are those who have been in the field for ten or more years.  This group may be reluctant to 
incorporate technology because they lack the technology skills needed.  This lack of skills is due mainly not having 
been  trained  or  not  having  been  technology  modeled  during  their  early  academic  career  (Rosenfeld  &  Martinez-
Pons,  2005).    Bandura  and  Schunk  (as  cited  in  Ertm

(p.33). 

Rovai and Childress (2003) found that computer apprehension or anxiety is related to psychological factors 
which can be helped with the right instruction, they suggest that those who take courses  which build self-efficacy 
and expand their knowledge of computers minimize the anxiety they feel towards integrating technology into actual 
classroom situations.  Christensen (2002) further reports technology anxiety may be reduced if faculty members are 
taken through training which offers several stages of adoption.  It is through these adoption stages that instructors 
increase their confidence and competency levels while integrating technology into coursework. 

ncies  and  comfort  with technology,  there 
should  be  a  stronger  likelihood  that  they  will  integrate  technology  successfully  into  their  classes.  However,  the 
internal  variables  discussed  above  are  only  half  of  the  story.    To  fully  understand  the  issues  surrounding  faculty

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 3.2  EXTERNAL FACTORS: 
External  factors  include  faculty  demographics,  specifically  age  and  gender,  class  size  and  institutional 
support.  Demographics such as age and gender may be primary factors that determine whether faculty members use 
technology  (Cooper,  2006,  p.331).    In  their  study,  Peluchette  and  Rust,  (2005)  state  that  at  the  university  level, 
faculty who are in the middle of their ca
to  competitive  pressures,  revise  programs  to  meet  the  needs  of  increasingly  diverse  students,  and  integrate  new 
 as to why this may be true.  First of all, tenured 
faculty may not be compelled or motivated to use technology.  Secondly, older or senior faculty members may not 
have the knowledge or training to use technology.  This leads to competency issues for older or tenured faculty. 

Another demographic factor is gender differences.  According to Spots (1997), male faculty members tend 
to rate their knowledge and use of technology higher than their female counterparts.  However, female instructors 
take factors such as lack of time and lack of professional advancement into consideration when deciding whether or 
not to integrate technology into the curriculum.  Additionally, Lumpe and Chambers (2001) posit from their study 
that female instructors are more likely to believe that external factors, such as administrators, students, equipment, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1272  

 Fahad N. Alfahad  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   46  ( 2012 )  1268  1278 

According  to  Pleuchette  and  Rust  (2005),  another  external  factor,  namely    class  size,  can  negatively 
influence technology use.  When faculty members use technologies such as email and chat rooms, larger classes can 
be difficult to manage, especially when teaching an online course.  According to Kelly and Maushak (2004) there is 
no  answer  to  the  question  of  what  the  ideal  class  size  is,  as  subject  matter  as  well  as  the  types  of  assignments 
instructors use are factors to take into consideration when integrating technology into the curriculum. 

Institutional  support,  the  final  external  factor  reviewed,  encompasses  a  wide  range  of  topics  including 
faculty development, ease of access for faculty members who wish to use technology, policies and procedures and 
support  for  technological  issues.    Osika  (2006)  argues    successful  technology  programs  require  support  from  the 

engaged with supporting instructional technology, especially online technologies, are those institutions that include 
technology support in their long-term strategic plans. 

It  is  clear  that  successfully  incorporating  technology  as  well  as  distance  learning  programs  into  the 
curriculum is a complex issue facing institutions of higher learning.  This issue is complicated further by the various 
factors which influence instructor's use of information technology in a classroom setting. 

This  survey  focuses  on  the  undergraduate  student's,  experiences  with  and  opinions  about  information 
technology.  The primary goal of the study is to better understand student experiences with information technology, 

associated devices.

Header: 5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The primary goal of the study was to have a better understanding of student experiences with information 
technology (IT), which, in turn, can help school's leadership to respond to the IT needs.  Tables 1 and 2 shows the 
percentage  of  the  descriptive  statistics 
technology. 

61.5% of these surveyed or 99 out of the 161 participants (weekly/ several time per week), have used the electronic 
device  in  their  course  activities,  while  13.7%  of  the  remaining  students  stated  that  they    only  use  the  electronic 
devices once per semester.

Survey  respondents  (monthly,  weekly),  often  use  an  electronic  device  to  get  access  to  a  library  resource 
(Q.2, (74 %), and a large number of students use IT for  blogging  (daily/ weekly),  (86.9 %) or 140 out of the 161 
participants (Q.9). 

Interestingly,  72%,  116  participants  out  of  the  161  are  often  doing  online  shopping  (Q.8),  (once  per 

semester /Monthly). 

We  found  that  the  majority  (87.6%)  of  the  students  or  141  students  often  create,  read,  send  e-mail  and 

instant messages (daily / weekly) (Q.5).

59% or 95 students are using the electronic devices once per semester/monthly. 

However,  52.2%  or  84  students  often  use  the  electronic  devices  for  writing  documents  for  course  work 
(Q.4) (weekly/ several times per week).  Only 10.6% or 17 out of 161  of the remaining participants are using the 
devices daily. 

When  students  were  asked  "how  often  do  you  create  web  pages?  (Q.13);  52.8%  or  85  out  of  161 

participants said they created web pages (once per semester) and only 7.5% or 12 students created web pages daily. 

49.1%  or  79  students  often  access  a  course  managements  system  (Q.14%) (Once  per  semester)  and  only 

5% or 8 students out of 161 participants  access a course   managements daily. 

Regarding  the  use  of  electronic  devices  for  creating  presentations  (Q.12);  only  5%  or  8  students  of  the  
participants  were  creating  presentations  daily.    Meanwhile  52%  or  84  students  created  presentation  (once  per 
semester/monthly). 

Respondents used the electronic device many times daily and doing online activities, for university, work 
and recreation.  The most frequent times used daily (18.26%) a total of (53.33%) times per week.  There are also 
those who spent (26.27%) times per semester, and (20.39%) times monthly using the electronic device. 

Respondents  were  quite  diverse  in  how  they  spent  their  time  using  technology.    E-mail  and  writing 
documents for courses have become ubiquitous; the majority of  respondent use e-mail daily and write documents, 
for their courses at least several times per week.  The use of university or college library Web site is not far behind. 

However, Table 3, gives the results of extracted communalities of all the variables.  It shows the proportion 
of the variance of a variable explained by the common factors.  From Table 3,it is very clear that "how often do you 
use an electronic device as an in-class requirement?" Q.3 has the least percentage ((30.0%) of variance that can be 
predicted  or  explained  by  other  13  variables.    On  the  other  hand,  "how  often  do  you  use  an  electronic  device  for

Another  statistical  analysis  instrument  is  the  reliability  coefficient,  Cronbach's  Alpha  (Cronbach,  1951) 

used to estimate the scale of consistency among items in the group (Hair et al. 1998).   

Cronbach's  Alpha  was  used  to  determine  the  internal  consistency  of  each  scale  in  this  research.    A 
Cronbach's  Alpha  coefficient is  close  to  1.0  means that  the  questions are  measuring  similar  dimensions  of  factor.  
Although the general limit is 0.7, score 0.6 would be acceptable because of the exploratory nature of this research.  
By  this  standard,  any  factor  with  Cronbach's  Alpha  coefficient  less  than  0.6  should  be  eliminated.    Table  4, 
illustrates the factors extracted from factor analysis and the Chronbach's alpha for reliability analysis of data.

Factor  analysis  led  14  questionnaire  statements.    As  a  result  of  the  reliability  analysis,  two  of  the  three 
factors  received  Cronbach's  alpha  coefficient  greater  than  0.6,  which  indicate    that  those  two  factors  should  be 
accepted. 

The internal consistency represented by coefficient Alpha, of all items is as much as 0.7510.  It reports the 
existence of cohesive internal relationships of all measurements in representing the information technology used and 
this result provides confidence that statistical results produced are coming from a stable measurement source. 

The first component represents the most contributory elements to the use of information technology.  Alpha 
value of this factor is 0.7310 representing internal consistency of this component.  The Alpha value of the Second 
factor is 0.6200, which is very low owing to the very limited number items (3 items).  The Alpha value of the third 
factory is 0.3370, which is very low owing to the very limited number of items (2 items). 

Factor analysis led fourteen questionnaire statements into three components 1-5, 9, 11-13; 6, 7, 10 and 8, 
14, form factors 1, 2 and 3 respectively (Table 4).  These factors contribute to the explanation in student information 
technology variable (49.27%) of total variance. 

The first component represents the most influential element on IT at a figure of 24.55% of total variance 
explained.    It  signifies  the  group  of  items  measuring  use  of  IT  for  course  activity,  library  resources,  in-class 
requirement, writing documents for coursework, e-mail, blogging, creating spread sheets (excel, etc.), presentations 
(power point, etc.) and creating web pages.  This tells us that the respondents perceived the items in this group as 
one factor.  Alpha value of this factor was 0.7310 representing a high internal consistency of this component. 

IT could be explained by the second factor, 14.49% of the total variance in this study.  The items under this 
group depict the use of IT in playing computer games, web-based music or videos and participation in online social 
networks  (face  book,  you  tube,  and  .com  etc.).    The  result  shows  that  respondents  perceived  all  types  of

Header: Introduction 
Information  technology  (IT)  refers  to  an  integrated  framework  of  computers,  software  applications,  multimedia 
content, the Internet, web-based applications, learning management systems (e.g. IVLE) and other tools that can be 
used to enhance the teaching and learning process.  The benefits of using IT in teaching are supported by research 
and literature also integrating IT into the curriculum as it helps to improve the quality of teaching and learning.  The 
subject  of  IT  tops  the  agenda  of  almost  every  college  and  university  today  because  of  the  expectations  of  a 
technologically  advancing  society  and  because  aggressive  IT  utilization  is  seen  as  an  indicator  of  a  progressive 
institution (Milligan, 2010;Shanon et al(2009); Caruso,J.B. et al 2007). 
The rapid information technology (IT) advances have extended to all aspects of  business including the accounting 
profession.  The impacts of the dynamic nature of IT on accounting practices force accounting education to reform 
its programmes in order to keep pace with changes in the profession.  IT skills have become another mandatory skill 
for  practising  accountants  (Bouchard,  2005;  Kepczyk,  2005)  besides  other  generic  skills  such  as  leadership  skill, 
communication skill and general business knowledge (Robert Half International Inc., 2003). The Issue of integrating 
IT  skills  in  accounting  education  has  been  a  continuing  concern  for  many  parties  including  professionals, 
educational  bodies  as  well  as  accounting  educators  all  over  the  world  (AAA,  1986;AECC,  1990;IFAC,  1995a, 
2003;Salleh, 2000;Chang and Hwang, 2003; Ahmed, 2003, Lin et al, 2005; Jones and Abraham, 2007). 
Academics  and  professional  organizations  have  called  for  IT  competent  graduates  and  have  voiced  concern  over 
whether  accounting  education  can  effectively  and  efficiently  prepare  accountants  to  meet  the  challenges  (AAA, 
1986; AECC, 1990; Dearing, 1997:Lyons, 1997; Boritz, 1999; Stoner, 1999; Albrecht and Sack, 2000; IFAC, 1995,

2003;Howieson, 2003;Chang and Hwang, 2003;Lin et al. 2005; Jones and Abraham, 2007).  They acknowledge the 
need for greater development of higher level transferable skills including IT skills in accounting programmes. 
                 Researchers,  business  leaders,  professional,  educators  as  well  as  academic  organizations  have  made 
rigorous initiatives and efforts to strengthen IT integration in accounting education.  These include (but not limited 
to)  Bhaskar,  (1982;1983),  Er  and  Ng,  (1989),  Collier  et  al.,  (1990),  Crawford  and  Barr,  (1998)  and  Salleh, 
(2000)who  discuss  alterative  uses  of  the  computer  in  accounting  education.    Besides,  there  are  professional 
accounting  bodies  and  academic  organizations  such  as  BAA-SIG  accounting  education,  BAAEC  ,  Dearing 
(1997)IFAC(1995,2003) and QAA(2000a,2000b,2000c) that encourage and provide some guidance to integrate IT 
in  accounting  programmes.  For  example  Dearing  (1997)  recommends  establishing  the  Professional  Institute  of 
Learning and Teaching in Higher Education which has among its functions a leading role in assisting institutions to 
exploit the potential of communications and information technology  for learning and teaching.  Last but not least, 
there are some educators (these include) Marriot, 1992; Marriot et al., 1999; Sangster, 1992, 1995a, 1995b; Sangster 
and  Mulligan,  1997;  Larres  and  Radcliffe,  2000;  Larres  et  al.,(  2003)  who  report  on  their  actual  experience  in 
integrating IT into their taught accounting units. 

IT with its new technologies serves a number of functions.  Brown (2000) refers to these functions as that 

digital and information form.  In the field 
of  education,  IT  is  commonly  seen  as  how  computers  and  the  Internet  can  best  be  harnessed  to  improve  the 
efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  process  of  teaching  and  learning  (Guha,  2003).    It  can  have  a  transformative 
effect  on educational systems because it is a potentially powerful tool for extending educational opportunities and 
greatly facilitate the acquisition and absorption of knowledge (Conlon & Simpson, 2003) with the use of computers.  
It  tends  to  redefine  teacher  and  student roles  and  beliefs  about  teaching and  learning  (Guha,  2003).    The  teacher 
becomes a coach and collaborator rather than a dispenser of knowledge  with the implementation of computer use 
into schools. 

This  paper describes and analyzes trends in the information technologies and the impact these have on the 
education  sector  as  a  whole,  but  particularly  on  the  higher  education  sector.    These  technologies  can  be  used  to 
address the changing demands within the sector: 

For more flexible learning. 
For extension of university services to national and international markets; and  
For more cost-effective delivery of higher education in an increasingly competitive environment. 

The growing use of information technologies in education is part of a wider technological revolution, evidenced 

in: 
The increasing use of computers and the Internet in Saudi Arabia. 
The growth of the on-line economy within Saudi Arabia. 
The Increasing competition in communication services.  
The broader public policy environment regarding the learning society and the use of educational technology.

Header: 3.LITERATURE REVIEW: 
The need for IT competency development in undergraduate accounting education is acknowledged in the 
literature  by  accounting  educators  and  practitioners,  as  is  mentioned  in  the  background  to  the  study  in  the 
introduction section. This includes among others Albrecht and Sack, 2000; Ahmed, 2003; Howieson, 2003; Chang 
and Hwang, 2003; Lin et. al. 2005; Jones and Abraham,  2007.  Most of the studies were informed by a quantitative 
approach  based  on  survey  data  except  Albrecht  and  Sack  (2000),  which  complements  the  survey  data  with 
interviews.    Basically,  they  investigate the  extent to  which the  IT  skills  as  outlined  by  (Albrecht and  Sack,  2000; 
Howieson, 2003; Chang and Hwang, 2003; Lin et al. 2005; Jones and Abraham, 2007) and IFAC/IEG-11 (Ahmed, 
2003), are developed in the accounting programmes in various countries such as USA  (Albrecht & Sack,2000;Cang 
& Hwang, 2003 ), China (Lin et. al., 2005), UK (Ahmed, 2003) and Egypt (Ahmed, 2003).  While the studies reveal 
the degree of the IT skills development relative to the guidelines, they  fail to discover other important issues like

approaches  used  to  develop  the  skills,  awareness  of  educators  on  the  guidelines, and  the reason  of  developing as 
well as not developing the skills. 

What IT competencies are and how they should be developed in undergraduate studies are two important 
questions  to  be  explored  in  order  to  ensure  a  successful  implementation  of  developping  IT  competencies  in 
accounting graduates.  The subsequent subsections review literature on guidelines on IT skills development, possible 
ways of developing IT skills and issues in implementing them and key success and failure factors. 

Kvavik and Caruso (2005) found  that students actually support a moderate amount of technology in their 
courses.    They  also  reported  that  students  have  lower  skill  levels  in  course-related  technologies,  such  as  using 
specialized  software,  or  a  course  management  system,  such  as  Blackboard.    Therefore,  assessing  the  level  of 
Information  Technology  (IT)  literacy  on  a  given  campus  is  important  in  making  decisions  regarding  technology 
incorporation into curriculum and other future campus-wide investments in technology resources (Tyler, 2005). 

Even though, technology is more available for instructors now than ever before, many of them are resistant 
to incorporating technology into their classrooms.  Cuban (1999) states that professors and students at the university 
level have grown comfortable with e-mail and Web pages, but less than 10 percent of faculty use these technologies 
for teaching.  However, even those instructors who embrace technology still find barriers that inhibit its use in the 
classroom.  In a study  by  Brill and Galloway (2007), two limitations to the use  of technology in instruction were 
noted: inadequate availability of technology, and classrooms that do not adequately support technology.  Ultimately, 
the decision to use technology is up to the instructor.  While the examples above illustrate some of the barriers to the 

to use technology in the classroom. 

Fortunately,  previous  research  on  IT  provides  some  valuable  insights.    Various  factors  such  as  feelings, 
beliefs,  attitudes  and  perceptions  have  emerged  from  the  literature  as  inputs  into  the  decision  whether  or  not  to 
ty  and  can  be 
confusing.  However, when broken into two categories, internal and external factor trends emerge that make them 
more understandable.

technology  in 
teaching are  individual  beliefs  (Albion  &  Ertmer,  2002),  feelings  and  anxiety  (Dusik,2000),fears,  preferences  and 
perceptions(  Grasha  &Yangabar-Hicks,2000)  and  feelings  of  competence  (Dusik,  2000).    Kane,  through  her 
assessment of available 

incorporate  new  pedagogy  into  teaching  is 
have previously learned.  Given this, one can extrapolate that if an instructor has a positive attitude or orientation 
towards technology, he will be more inclined to incorporate it into his teaching. 

Another way beliefs influence the decision whether or not to integrate technology is the view the instructor 
has towards various teaching practices and styles.  Grasha and Hicks (2000, p.3) found that teaching styles are based 
ds, emotions, motives, beliefs, and attitudes of the teacher and that these teaching practices, when used 

teacher's  decisions  to  integrate  technology  into  instruction  are  based  on  their  teaching  styles  and  strategies.  

-wave  (self-
starters), second-wave (traditionalists), third-wave (careerists), and fourth-wave (reluctants).  The personal beliefs of 
each  group  encourage  or  hinder  the  use  of  technology  in  instruction.    For  example,  fourth-wave  instructors 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fahad N. Alfahad  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   46  ( 2012 )  1268  1278 

1271

(reluctants)  are  not  enthusiastic  when  it  involves  technology  integration  because  this  group  believes  in  the 
-centered and repetitious model of learning 

(Ferguson, 2004, p.136). 

These  beliefs  which  are  to  group  faculty  members  are  often  developed  early  in  their  academic  career.  

about using technology while they are in school themselves, or after they begin their teaching careers, efforts should 
be made to improve their interaction with technology early in their careers. 

Competency,  another  internal  factor  that  determines  faculty  use  of  technology,  is  critical  in  making 

achers 

not feel well prepared are those who have been in the field for ten or more years.  This group may be reluctant to 
incorporate technology because they lack the technology skills needed.  This lack of skills is due mainly not having 
been  trained  or  not  having  been  technology  modeled  during  their  early  academic  career  (Rosenfeld  &  Martinez-
Pons,  2005).    Bandura  and  Schunk  (as  cited  in  Ertm

(p.33). 

Rovai and Childress (2003) found that computer apprehension or anxiety is related to psychological factors 
which can be helped with the right instruction, they suggest that those who take courses  which build self-efficacy 
and expand their knowledge of computers minimize the anxiety they feel towards integrating technology into actual 
classroom situations.  Christensen (2002) further reports technology anxiety may be reduced if faculty members are 
taken through training which offers several stages of adoption.  It is through these adoption stages that instructors 
increase their confidence and competency levels while integrating technology into coursework. 

ncies  and  comfort  with technology,  there 
should  be  a  stronger  likelihood  that  they  will  integrate  technology  successfully  into  their  classes.  However,  the 
internal  variables  discussed  above  are  only  half  of  the  story.    To  fully  understand  the  issues  surrounding  faculty

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 3.2  EXTERNAL FACTORS: 
External  factors  include  faculty  demographics,  specifically  age  and  gender,  class  size  and  institutional 
support.  Demographics such as age and gender may be primary factors that determine whether faculty members use 
technology  (Cooper,  2006,  p.331).    In  their  study,  Peluchette  and  Rust,  (2005)  state  that  at  the  university  level, 
faculty who are in the middle of their ca
to  competitive  pressures,  revise  programs  to  meet  the  needs  of  increasingly  diverse  students,  and  integrate  new 
 as to why this may be true.  First of all, tenured 
faculty may not be compelled or motivated to use technology.  Secondly, older or senior faculty members may not 
have the knowledge or training to use technology.  This leads to competency issues for older or tenured faculty. 

Another demographic factor is gender differences.  According to Spots (1997), male faculty members tend 
to rate their knowledge and use of technology higher than their female counterparts.  However, female instructors 
take factors such as lack of time and lack of professional advancement into consideration when deciding whether or 
not to integrate technology into the curriculum.  Additionally, Lumpe and Chambers (2001) posit from their study 
that female instructors are more likely to believe that external factors, such as administrators, students, equipment, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1272  

 Fahad N. Alfahad  /  Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences   46  ( 2012 )  1268  1278 

According  to  Pleuchette  and  Rust  (2005),  another  external  factor,  namely    class  size,  can  negatively 
influence technology use.  When faculty members use technologies such as email and chat rooms, larger classes can 
be difficult to manage, especially when teaching an online course.  According to Kelly and Maushak (2004) there is 
no  answer  to  the  question  of  what  the  ideal  class  size  is,  as  subject  matter  as  well  as  the  types  of  assignments 
instructors use are factors to take into consideration when integrating technology into the curriculum. 

Institutional  support,  the  final  external  factor  reviewed,  encompasses  a  wide  range  of  topics  including 
faculty development, ease of access for faculty members who wish to use technology, policies and procedures and 
support  for  technological  issues.    Osika  (2006)  argues    successful  technology  programs  require  support  from  the 

engaged with supporting instructional technology, especially online technologies, are those institutions that include 
technology support in their long-term strategic plans. 

It  is  clear  that  successfully  incorporating  technology  as  well  as  distance  learning  programs  into  the 
curriculum is a complex issue facing institutions of higher learning.  This issue is complicated further by the various 
factors which influence instructor's use of information technology in a classroom setting. 

This  survey  focuses  on  the  undergraduate  student's,  experiences  with  and  opinions  about  information 
technology.  The primary goal of the study is to better understand student experiences with information technology, 

associated devices.

Header: 5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The primary goal of the study was to have a better understanding of student experiences with information 
technology (IT), which, in turn, can help school's leadership to respond to the IT needs.  Tables 1 and 2 shows the 
percentage  of  the  descriptive  statistics 
technology. 

61.5% of these surveyed or 99 out of the 161 participants (weekly/ several time per week), have used the electronic 
device  in  their  course  activities,  while  13.7%  of  the  remaining  students  stated  that  they    only  use  the  electronic 
devices once per semester.

Survey  respondents  (monthly,  weekly),  often  use  an  electronic  device  to  get  access  to  a  library  resource 
(Q.2, (74 %), and a large number of students use IT for  blogging  (daily/ weekly),  (86.9 %) or 140 out of the 161 
participants (Q.9). 

Interestingly,  72%,  116  participants  out  of  the  161  are  often  doing  online  shopping  (Q.8),  (once  per 

semester /Monthly). 

We  found  that  the  majority  (87.6%)  of  the  students  or  141  students  often  create,  read,  send  e-mail  and 

instant messages (daily / weekly) (Q.5).

59% or 95 students are using the electronic devices once per semester/monthly. 

However,  52.2%  or  84  students  often  use  the  electronic  devices  for  writing  documents  for  course  work 
(Q.4) (weekly/ several times per week).  Only 10.6% or 17 out of 161  of the remaining participants are using the 
devices daily. 

When  students  were  asked  "how  often  do  you  create  web  pages?  (Q.13);  52.8%  or  85  out  of  161 

participants said they created web pages (once per semester) and only 7.5% or 12 students created web pages daily. 

49.1%  or  79  students  often  access  a  course  managements  system  (Q.14%) (Once  per  semester)  and  only 

5% or 8 students out of 161 participants  access a course   managements daily. 

Regarding  the  use  of  electronic  devices  for  creating  presentations  (Q.12);  only  5%  or  8  students  of  the  
participants  were  creating  presentations  daily.    Meanwhile  52%  or  84  students  created  presentation  (once  per 
semester/monthly). 

Respondents used the electronic device many times daily and doing online activities, for university, work 
and recreation.  The most frequent times used daily (18.26%) a total of (53.33%) times per week.  There are also 
those who spent (26.27%) times per semester, and (20.39%) times monthly using the electronic device. 

Respondents  were  quite  diverse  in  how  they  spent  their  time  using  technology.    E-mail  and  writing 
documents for courses have become ubiquitous; the majority of  respondent use e-mail daily and write documents, 
for their courses at least several times per week.  The use of university or college library Web site is not far behind. 

However, Table 3, gives the results of extracted communalities of all the variables.  It shows the proportion 
of the variance of a variable explained by the common factors.  From Table 3,it is very clear that "how often do you 
use an electronic device as an in-class requirement?" Q.3 has the least percentage ((30.0%) of variance that can be 
predicted  or  explained  by  other  13  variables.    On  the  other  hand,  "how  often  do  you  use  an  electronic  device  for

Another  statistical  analysis  instrument  is  the  reliability  coefficient,  Cronbach's  Alpha  (Cronbach,  1951) 

used to estimate the scale of consistency among items in the group (Hair et al. 1998).   

Cronbach's  Alpha  was  used  to  determine  the  internal  consistency  of  each  scale  in  this  research.    A 
Cronbach's  Alpha  coefficient is  close  to  1.0  means that  the  questions are  measuring  similar  dimensions  of  factor.  
Although the general limit is 0.7, score 0.6 would be acceptable because of the exploratory nature of this research.  
By  this  standard,  any  factor  with  Cronbach's  Alpha  coefficient  less  than  0.6  should  be  eliminated.    Table  4, 
illustrates the factors extracted from factor analysis and the Chronbach's alpha for reliability analysis of data.

Factor  analysis  led  14  questionnaire  statements.    As  a  result  of  the  reliability  analysis,  two  of  the  three 
factors  received  Cronbach's  alpha  coefficient  greater  than  0.6,  which  indicate    that  those  two  factors  should  be 
accepted. 

The internal consistency represented by coefficient Alpha, of all items is as much as 0.7510.  It reports the 
existence of cohesive internal relationships of all measurements in representing the information technology used and 
this result provides confidence that statistical results produced are coming from a stable measurement source. 

The first component represents the most contributory elements to the use of information technology.  Alpha 
value of this factor is 0.7310 representing internal consistency of this component.  The Alpha value of the Second 
factor is 0.6200, which is very low owing to the very limited number items (3 items).  The Alpha value of the third 
factory is 0.3370, which is very low owing to the very limited number of items (2 items). 

Factor analysis led fourteen questionnaire statements into three components 1-5, 9, 11-13; 6, 7, 10 and 8, 
14, form factors 1, 2 and 3 respectively (Table 4).  These factors contribute to the explanation in student information 
technology variable (49.27%) of total variance. 

The first component represents the most influential element on IT at a figure of 24.55% of total variance 
explained.    It  signifies  the  group  of  items  measuring  use  of  IT  for  course  activity,  library  resources,  in-class 
requirement, writing documents for coursework, e-mail, blogging, creating spread sheets (excel, etc.), presentations 
(power point, etc.) and creating web pages.  This tells us that the respondents perceived the items in this group as 
one factor.  Alpha value of this factor was 0.7310 representing a high internal consistency of this component. 

IT could be explained by the second factor, 14.49% of the total variance in this study.  The items under this 
group depict the use of IT in playing computer games, web-based music or videos and participation in online social 
networks  (face  book,  you  tube,  and  .com  etc.).    The  result  shows  that  respondents  perceived  all  types  of

Title: Research on the Innovation and Applications on Sports Equipment, PDF: Research_papers_50\19262 (1).pdf
Header: Introduction 
With  the  improvement  of  the  level of  economic  development  and  progress  of  social  life,  people's 
degree of concern for the health gradually improved, "Health First, lifetime sports" has developed 
into a new era of sports theme. With the ever-increasing sports items, sports equipment innovation 
has  put  forward  new  demands.  Traditional  sports  equipment  obviously  does  not  meet  the 
development requirements of the new era and innovation and reform have become the trend of the 
times of sports equipment application.

Header: The Meaning and Role of Sports Equipment   
Sports equipment is used in sports and fitness workout facilities, equipment, and supplies. With the 
continuous improvement of people's health awareness, making the sport gradually become popular, 
daily  life,  which  is  the  development  of  sports  equipment  put  forward  higher  requirements.  The 
emergence  of  new  sports  to  strengthen  the  linkages  sports  equipment  and  sports  between.  Stable 
performance, excellent quality and secure sports equipment not only to enhance the public's interest 
in  sports,  and  to  improve  the  level  of  people's  movement  to  some  extent.  Physical  exercise  and 
fitness  inseparable  material  conditions,  and  sports  equipment  is  one  of  the  important  material 
conditions. The use of sports equipment to improve people's physical coordination and flexibility, 
increase muscle strength, meanwhile, can help foster a strong will. The use of sports equipment can 
make people get a wide range of exercise  and  training,  can be  said to be  a key  element of sports 
items indispensable [1].   

The Current Status of Sports Equipment Applications   

The Shortage of Sports Equipment. In many places, due to lack of funding for education, leading 
to  a  serious  shortage  of  school  sports  equipment,  the  use  of  equipment  is  often  purchased  many 
years  ago,  a  large  proportion  of  the  instruments  are  in  a  state  of  serious  damage  or  imminent 
damage, plus management of confusion on the instrument, the user PE teachers in most schools is 
both  devices  is  the  manager,  resulting  in  some  equipment  because  it  is  not  timely  maintenance 
becomes waste, such as discarded hurdles frame, rusty shot and so on. There are some equipment to 
become private property, but only a handful of genuine use of the equipment.   

International Conference on Education Technology, Management and Humanities Science (ETMHS 2015)  2015. The authors - Published by Atlantis Press218The Sports  Equipment  Utilization  is  Low.  As  Risk-free  teaching.  Concept  promoted  in  high 
school  physical  education  in  most  schools  and  students  in  physical  education  teachers  worry  too 
much  because  sports  equipment  operation  errors  caused  by  accident,  so  try  to  avoid  physical 
education teaching technology difficult, dangerous, may cause harm to the teaching instrument even 
in the teaching process does not use basic equipment, resulting in high school physical education, 
there is a large part of the equipment to be shelved in the side, did not play its due role. 

The Sports Equipment Teaching Method is Single. Most physical education teachers teaching 
thinking  limited  to  a  fixed  mode  of  teaching,  often  only  watch  sports  equipment  inherent  in  the 
nature of property, while ignoring its potential properties, to a certain extent, resulting in a waste of 
resources. For example, in addition to hurdle hurdles can also be used to do. Small football door. 
Can also be used as a drill more obstacles, etc.; throwing medicine balls can be used in addition to, 
but also as a teaching and game markers, obstacles, etc.; rubber band in addition to playing games 
to jump, but also can be used for Rally training students in the arms, hierarchical jump exercises; 
sandbags can be done in addition to the game. Played. . Fight snails. , Kicking sandbags, you can 
also. Race with. Too far away to see who voted; so. Rational use of sports equipment, both on the 
re-use of limited resources, but also saves an effective way of sports resources [2]. 

The Innovative and Specific Applications of Sports Equipment   

Development  of  sports  equipment  in  the  sport  is  not  perfect,  there  are  many  aspects  need 
improvement and innovation. Traditional sports equipment limited number of huge size, not easy to 
carry, is not conducive to the promotion of the use. To enhance people's sports concept, innovative 
sports equipment will be carried out. Innovative sports equipment can stimulate people's interest in 
sport and will help promote the popularity of sport   

The Innovation and Application of Light Equipment. Light equipment is most likely to gain 
popularity and promotion of sports equipment, in sport on light equipment innovation, can enhance 
people's interest in sports. Light sports equipment range is very wide, you can take advantage of life 
items to innovation and transformation. For example, the use of waste cans or bottles made into a 
dumbbell, which is loaded in the right amount of gravel that can readily be placed to facilitate the 
movement  of  the  location,  at  any  time  exercise;  clothing  can  also  make  use  of  waste  handmade 
football,  inside  with  a  soft  material  filled.  Life  objects  can  be  utilized,  made  into  a  portable  light 
sports equipment,  which can not only increase people's interest in sports, but also to cultivate the 
awareness of innovation[3].   

Traditional  small  rural  kindergarten  in  sports  equipment  such  as  shuttlecock,  ropes,  ball, 
windmill, sandbags, gymnastic rings, light and exquisite, easy to use, the kids really like it, but over 
time, children would have no interest. So can every so often, in the above plus some new equipment, 
or add a new component flexibility on the same kind of equipment, inspire children to change the 
play.  For  example  coupled  with  sandbags  half  Sprite,  were  throwing  and  catching  activities;  ball 
coupled with a small stick, turned into a "catch pig" and so on. 

The  Innovation  and  Application  of  Used  Sports  Equipment.  Sports  equipment  that  is 
commonly  used  in  everyday  sports  people  often  come  into  contact  with  sports  equipment  or 
equipment. Development and use in the original motion capabilities to maximize the functionality 
of existing sports equipment. Reasonable innovations and improvements to the original function can 
be  improved,  to  compensate  for  the  defect,  there  is  conducive  to  promoting  the  development  of 
sports  equipment.  For  example,  the  now  popular.  Long  has  style  table  tennis  bat.  Is  the  original 
horizontal position and Penhold improved and integrated, draw a new racket this new racket in front 
of the original racket handle an additional grip with the thumb and forefinger coincide small handle, 
this pair improved grip makes the racket can be more widely used, easy to carry out in-depth sports 
items.  For  commonly  used  sports  equipment  innovations  to  improve  the  promotion  of  the  sport, 
increase people's enthusiasm. 

The  Innovation  and  Application  of  Living  Appliances.  Sport  is  a  mass  of  sport,  but  not 
limited  ages,  different  sports  have  different  preferences  populations  in  different  populations  use 
different  sports  equipment,  through  the  everyday  life  of  mining  equipment  and  improved 

219functionality  ,  to  innovate  a  variety  of  practical  and  convenient  sports  equipment.  For  example, 
commonly  used in people's daily lives  bike, its  innovation and  transformation,  you can become a 
sports  equipment.  According  to  the  basic  principles  of  bicycle  innovation  on  the  structure  and 
function, it is possible to develop a new product. Innovative use of different bike models the size of 
the wheel wheelbarrow, wheelbarrow high flexibility, can enhance flexibility and coordination body 
of  the  people  to  some  extent,  improve  people's  physical  fitness,  and  thus  serve  the  purpose  of 
physical exercise. 

Using life in a variety of waste materials is an effective way to enrich the kind of small sports 
equipment.  On  the  one  hand,  inspire  children  clever  use  of  all  kinds  of  waste  materials,  such  as 
encouraging children from their homes with some scrap cardboard, cut a round, square and so on. 
Then  in  the  above  draw  their  favorite  designs,  colorful  "flying  saucer"  was  born;  also  allows 
children  to  use  scrap  cardboard,  according  to  his  own  hand  type  cut  only  a  "small  hands",  fitted 
with elastic bands, children wear it they can freely learn critters crawling flutter [4].   

Homemade instruments for its economic, convenient, strong, handsome features, more and more 
teachers  attention.  By  using  homemade  instruments  to  carry  out  research  activities,  physical 
exercise,  kindergarten outdoor  two  hours  to  carry  out  activities  to  flourish.  At  the event,  teachers 
correctly handle the relationship between teacher and child-led body, get rid of the past, "I'll teach 
you  to learn"  concept,  more  leading  role  of  teachers  in  the  creation  of environment  for  providing 
materials  and  other  aspects  of  early  childhood  development  guide  reflected.  At  the  event,  new 
equipment to improve the children participate in activities of interest, their initiative and creativity 
to get a lot of play. In "Let each child succeed," the concept to guide young children to explore the 
chances of success increase, they dare to try new methods, self-confidence and willpower has been 
enhanced greatly improved activity atmosphere, truly received the effectiveness of activities. 

The  Innovation  and  Application  of  the  Equipment  in  Sports  Teaching.  For  high  school 
physical education in sports equipment innovation, but also an important part of sports equipment 
innovation,  innovate  teaching  instruments  can  enhance  students'  interest  in  learning,  enhance 
teaching  effectiveness.  In  traditional  teaching,  basketball  is  a  sport  loved  by  students,  basketball 
equipment  for  innovation,  you  can  use  the  lift  basketball,  mobile  basketball,  basketball  rings 
without board or a board more than three times basketball, etc., this new reform can stimulate the 
curiosity  of  students  and  attract  students  to  participate  in  sports;  volleyball  popularization  and 
promotion,  the  use  of  U-volleyball  nets,  volleyball  can  lift  racks;  or  have  additional  features  and 
local folk traditions of sports equipment , are able to stimulate students' interest in sports to achieve 
in  sports  promotion.  Through  sports  equipment  innovation  and  reform,  both  to  achieve  the 
promotion  of  original  sports  equipment  function,  but  also  can  stimulate  people's  enthusiasm  for 
sports  projects.  Simple  and  practical  sports  equipment  to  facilitate  future  popularization  and 
promotion,  can  make  people  more  deeply  implement  the  concept  of  lifelong  physical,  achieve 
universal participation in sports in the past. 

The Innovation and Application of the Site Instruments. We should fully play the role of the 
existing instruments and give full play to the role of existing instruments. For example: when doing 
sports  acrobatics,  from  heel  cushions  can  be  changed  horizontally,  before  this  practice  roll, 
backward roll, kneel jump, shoulder and elbow inverted, head handstand etc, can a student from the 
original piece of mat exercises , while the increase for the two students to practice (this, density and 
volume  movement  classes  doubled).  Another  example  is  the  horizontal  bar  hopped  on  a  positive 
support, the support placed under a single hanging knee, single (double) pedal to turn on to support 
such action, can be two people on a horizontal bar to practice [5]. 

Think  of  ways  to  alternative  instruments.  To  compensate  the  lack  of  instruments,  we  should 
promote the use of alternative instruments. For example on the side box horse vault, straddle vault 
etc, can be done on the goat, goat's length and width is not enough, you can bring with Larsson tight 
lengthened  symbolically,  widened.  Before  some  action  on  the  horizontal  bar,  such  as  the  low  bar 
overhang,  jumped  support  after  swing,  the  swing  ride  back  brace  front  legs  to  stand  under  the 
swivel  90  degrees  and  other  actions  can  be  carried  out  exercises  on  parallel  bars  on  the  side  bar, 
parallel bars support under the backswing swing and can also be used under suppression box swing 

220back  leg  brace  on  vault  and  vault  stoop  swing  leg  brace  instead.  Alternative  exercise  equipment 
movements,  sometimes  though  not  completely  replace  the  original  materials,  but  the  task  is 
completed courses have some role in promoting.

Title: Reflexive Debate on Use of Philosophy in Scientific Research, PDF: Research_papers_50\22.pdf
Header: University of Zambia 
*Corresponding Author: Manoah Muchanga, University of Zambia 

Abstract: How should philosophy be used in scientific research? is the question addressed in this paper. The 
aim  of  this  desktop  research  was  to  critically  contribute  to  the  already  ongoing  debate  around  the  use  of 
philosophy in scientific research and to propose a user friendly framework on how to integrate philosophical 
decisions with methodological decisions. This paper argues that the content and length of a research does not 
make  it  scientific,  but  its  philosophical  foundation  and  related  methodologies.  It  also  shows  that  use  of 
philosophy in research is not merely a recitation, repetition and dumping of borrowed words, but a reasoned 
and  careful  re-contextualization  of  philosophical  assumptions  to  apply  them  to  ones  own  research  thesis. 
There is also no such a thing as epistemological and ontological monovalence because there are many ways 
of  creating  and  understanding  reality  and,  moreover,  which  paradigmatic  framework  is  better  partly 
depends  on  the  research  question(s)  one  seeks  to  answer.  Only  if  we  understood  each  philosophy  and  its 
assumptions, would we be in a better position to challenge them and, reflexively think differently. 

Key words: Philosophy, Epistemology, Ontology, Research, Education, Science 

1.  INTRODUCTION  

The probity, perspicacity and profundity of research is more dependent on the onto-espistemic process 
than  its  methodologic  context  because  the  latter  is  dependent  on  the  former,  influencing  research 
conduct  models  and  implementation  process.  Although  Bless  and  Achola  (1990)  argue  that  the 
content of the subject matter does not make it scientific, but its methodology, such a perspective has 
to  be  approached  with  critical  reflexivity  and  constructive  confrontation  given  that,  there  is  no 
methodology without a legitimate core parent from the philosophies of science. Scientific researches 
that  are  framed  within  specific  philosophical  landscapes  have  much  to  contribute  to  expansive 
scientific and educational research dialogues than those that are devoid of it (Saunders  et al., 2007). 
Social  and  natural  science  disciplines  have  witnessed  a  myriad  of  ontological  confrontations,  each 
claiming to offer a superior analytic framework for making sense of core issues in various disciplines, 
whilst denigrating the other(s). What most consistently divide these schools of thought are not their 
substantive  claims  about  natural  and  social  phenomena,  but  their  metatheoretical  assumptions 
(philosophical  discussion  of  the  foundations,  structure,  or  results  of  some  theory)  concerning  how 
such claims should be developed and supported (Hartwig, 2010). The crux of the matter is, 'what is' in 
one discipline, is 'what is not' in another, depending on the ontological position taken by individual 
researchers. Even those who presumptuously claim onto-espistemic objectivity and purism are subject 
to  some  cryptic  value-ridden  influences  given  that,  they  are  guided  by  either  explicit  or  implicit 
axiological  assumptions  in  their  methodological  decisions,  which  truthfully  speaking,  rule  out 
concrete  universality  of  objectivity.  Whatever  the  discipline  may  be,  however  aggrandized  or 
denigrated its academic panoply, every researcher from any field must realize that, an important part 
of  any  academic  research  process  involves  ensuring  that  the  methodology  and  methods  used  are 
consistent with the ontological and epistemological assumptions of a particular philosophy of science 
(Guba,  1990).  Saunders  et  al.  (2007:100)  add  that,  "questions  of  research  design  and  methods  are 
secondary to questions of paradigm or philosophy". This chapter discusses the inter-relationship that 
exists among the philosophical approaches and methodological decisions.  

Philosophy comes from the Greek word Philosophia (Taneja, 2008). It is made up of two words, that 
is, philia (love) and Sophia (wisdom). Etymologically, philosophy turns out to be the love of wisdom 
and  whoever  loves  this  wisdom  is  a  philosopher  (Ibid).  Makumba  (2009)  defines  philosophy  as 
critical  thinking,  which  leads  to  the  knowledge  of  things  through  their  ultimate  cause.  It  is  also  a

critical pursuit of the truth and knowledge. To philosophize, therefore, is to reflect on the totality of 
things we encounter with a view to understanding the reason for their existence (Makumba, 2009). As 
a philosophical researcher, one is under obligation to delineate the cause of reality and to investigate 
and question all things that relates to research. In the words of Aristotle, all men by nature desire to 
know.  This  natural  desire  by  human  beings  to  know  the  truth  is  one  of  the  main  bedrocks  of 
philosophy  (Burr  and  Goldinger,  2012).  Since  philosophy  is  an  attempt  to  satisfy  this  thirst  for 
knowledge,  it  is  rightly  positioned  and  significant  in  scientific  research  in  general.  The  problem 
addressed by this desktop research is premised on the misunderstandings and scientific dystopia that 
scientific and social researchers especially the beginners may be experiencing regarding integration of 
philosophy in the research processes. 

2.  PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACHES IN RESEARCH 

Academic researchers have witnessed many battles among contending approaches, each claiming to 
offer a superior analytic framework for making sense of core issues in various disciplines. What most 
consistently  divides  various  schools  of  thought  is  not  their  substantive  claims  about  specific 
phenomena,  but  their  metatheoretical  assumptions  (Philosophical  discussion  of  the  foundations, 
structure or results of some theory) concerning how such claims should be developed and supported 
(Lot-Sisitka et al., 2013). In research, philosophies are also known as paradigms or research traditions 
(Saunders  et  al.,  2007).  We  need  to  be  alert  to  such  variations  in  wording  by  different  scholars. 
Generally, there are two broad approaches of philosophies or paradigms namely, positivism and post-
positivism. The former supports quantitative approaches whereas the latter is qualitative in nature. 

2.1. Positivism and Post-Positivism 

Positivism  is  quantitative  in  nature  and  focuses  on  traditional,  empirical  and  experimental  research 
approaches.  Some  of  its  major  proponents  include  John  Locke,  Emile  Durkheim  and  Augustine 
Comte (Taneja, 2008). The basic belief of positivism is realist ontology, that is, the belief that there 
exists  a  reality  out  there  driven  by  immutable  or  infallible  natural  laws  (Guba,  1990).  Its  core 
business is to discover true nature of reality and how it truly works. Once committed to a realist 
ontology, the positivist is constrained (non-transgressive) to practice an objectivist epistemology. The 
highly  esteemed  methodology  in  positivism  is  empirical  experimentalism  or  as  close  an 
approximation thereto as could be managed (Guba, 1990).   

Post-positivism  implies  after positivism.  It  is  also  known  as  post-empiricism.  It  is  a  philosophical 
model  of  scientific  inquiry  that  critiques  and  amends  positivism.  It  was  mainly  advanced  by 
Huberman,  Kant,  Wittgenstein  (Guba,  1990).  Post-positivism  affirms  that  theories,  background, 
knowledge and values of the researcher can influence what is observed. Post-positivists believe that 
human  knowledge  is  based  not  on  unchallengeable,  rock-solid  foundations,  but  upon  human 
construction of knowledge. In post-positivism, there is a belief in reality just like positivism does. 
However,  it  is  held  that  reality  can  only  be  known  imperfectly  and  probabilistically  because  it  is 
based on human construction (OLeany, 2004). Unlike positivism which tends to be methodologically 
conservative, post-positivism offers fairly transgressive  and liberative methodological options (Price, 
2013).  Investigating  ones own  epistemologies and  understanding  regarding  how  they  affect  him  or 
her as a researcher is an essential part of the post-positivist approach. As part of this investigation, you 
come  to  some  understanding  of  how  people  construct  and  maintain  perceptions  of  the  world. 
Examining our epistemology involves looking at the underlying assumptions we use to make sense of 
our day-to-day lives. You cannot claim to have no epistemology. Those who so claim have nothing 
but  a  bad  epistemology  (Bateson,  1977:  13).  A  good  researcher  always  remembers  to  state  the 
epistemological and ontological assumptions that govern his or her research. These two philosophical 
approaches  constitute  specific  paradigms  (it  is  not  the  focus  of  this  paper  to  discuss  such  specific 
philosophies) from which one would carefully choose depending on the nature of his or her research. 
Each specific philosophy, either from positivism or post-positivism, is guided by assumptions that can 
inform  research  in  different  practice contexts.  Although  axiological  assumptions  (to  be  summarized 
towards the end of this paper) also influence each paradigm, the main set of assumptions is divided 
into two, namely, epistemology and ontology (Burr and Goldinger, 2012).

Header: 2.2. Epistemological Dimension of Philosophy  
In the science of research, epistemology is made up of two Greek words, that is, Episteme which is a 
Greek  word  for  knowledge  and  Logos,  a  Greek  word  for  reason  or  discourse.  Literally,

Reflexive Debate on Use of Philosophy in Scientific Research

epistemology  is  a  reasoned  dialogue  about  knowledge.  It  is  also  defined  as  philosophical  reasoning 
about knowledge and the grounds on which knowledge is created (Makumba, 2009). Epistemology is 
also known as the theory of knowledge, and it is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of 
knowledge, particularly its foundations, scope, limits and validity. It questions what knowledge is and 
how it can be acquired, as well as the extent to which any given subject or entity can be known (Lotz-
Sisitka  et  al.,  2012).  Epistemology  is  centered  on  analyzing  the  nature  of  knowledge  and  how  it 
relates  to  connected  notions  such  as  truth,  belief  and  justification.  Epistemology  is  a  study  of  how 
people or systems of people know things and how they think they know things (Keeney, 1983:13). It 
is,  thus,  concerned  with  the  nature  of  knowledge,  what  constitutes  valid  knowledge,  what  can  be 
known and who can be a knower.

Philosophical  underpinning  is  important  in  research  as  this  leads  to  investigation  as  per  a 

specific paradigm. Every subject domain has a dominant paradigm in which the research is 

carried  out.  This  paper  surveys  various  journal  articles  in  finance,  specifically  in  financial 

markets  contagion  and  spillover  effects,  to  find  the  research  paradigms  and  finds  that  the 

dominant paradigm in finance and market contagion research is functionalism-positivist. This 

provides  opportunities  to  conduct  research  in  other  paradigmatic  approaches.  This  paper 

explores the possibility of using an interpretivist paradigm to the financial market contagion 

research.

(A) Introduction  

The  selection  of  an  appropriate  paradigm  lays  the  ground  for  the  intent,  inspiration  and 

expectations  of  research  (Mackenzie  and  Knipe,  2006).  This  essay  identifies  the  dominant 

philosophical position in the realm of Finance discipline specifically the areas of asset pricing, 

corporate finance and market efficiency. These areas provide the theoretical foundations for 

foreign  portfolio  investments  and  to  understand  the  financial  markets  contagion.  Several 

articles related to finance discipline and financial market contagion are surveyed to identify the 

 
 
 
philosophical underpinnings under which the research is carried out. This paper looks for the 

dominant paradigm in financial research specifically the area of financial market contagion. 

Further, this paper explores the possibility of conducting research in financial market contagion 

using interpretivist paradigm, a non-dominant paradigm in the disciplines research.   

The origins of philosophical thoughts are quite interesting as they originated from mythological 

beliefs followed by the natural philosophers (Heraclitus, Parmenides, Thales, Anaximander, 

Anaximenes, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, were all considered pre-Socratics) who 

were mainly concerned with the nature of the physical world. Around 450 B.C., the Sophists 

brought scepticism into philosophy and they, basically, questioned as to whether the natural 

phenomenon were understood because of social induction? These critical enquiries led to social 

criticism.  Socrates  tried  to  show  that  there  were  universally  valid  and  absolute  norms,  and 

finding  these  definitions  were  based  on  human  reason  alone  (rationalism)  (Gaarder,  1994). 

Rationalism is a philosophical view that knowledge is gained independently of stimulus from 

senses,  and  our  concepts  and  knowledge  is  constructed  purely  on  reason  (Markie,  2017). 

Aristotle (384-322 B.C) challenged the platonic ideal forms and opined that observation and 

categorisation  lead  to  knowledge  gathering.  Following  Ren  Descartes,  Rationalism  and 

Empiricism  became  dominant  in  research.  Empiricism  states  that  knowledge  is  based  on 

sensory experience (instead of innate ideas) and emphasizes empirically discovered evidence 

which  is  value-free.  Newtonss  Scientific  methods  and  empiricism  influenced  the  present 

philosophical  position  of  positivism.  This  brief  discussion  on  the  origins  of  the  philosophy 

provides us theoretical perspectives in philosophy. 

Etymology of Paradigm: It originates from the Greek word  (paradeigma) which 

means model, example or pattern. Guba and Lincoln (1994) defines paradigm as a set of beliefs, 

accepted on faith, about the researchers views of the world , its nature, his place in it and his 

relationship  with  it.  Thus,  a  paradigm  describes  the  ontological,  epistemological  and 

methodological  questions  to  the  problem  stated.  Thomas  Kuhn  (1996)  discusses  that  the 

common  characteristics  of  how  a  research  (scientific)  is  structured,  approached  and 

interpreted as a paradigm. Subjectivity and Objectivity are the two approaches to the study of 

social science.  This forms a continuum on which ontological, epistemological, human nature 

and  methodologies  vary  (Morgan  and  Smircich,  1980).    Table  1  shows some  definitions  of 

some of these terminologies constructed from OGorman (2008).

Header: Functionalism 
The philosophy 
Its  approach  is  to  search  for  rational  elucidations  of  social  affairs  with  a 
highly  pragmatic  orientation.  The  emphasis  is  on  generating  knowledge 
based on problem oriented approach, that is to find practical solutions to the 
problems at hand. 
Its  approach  is  to  seek  explanations  based  on  human  consciousness  and 
subjectivity. A researcher tries to generate knowledge from his individual 
perspective  rather  than  just  observing  as  a  detached  observer.    It  sees the 
social  world  as  a  process  emerging  out  of  the  human  interpretations  and 
involvement. 
This approach is based on Sociology of radical change. It has a subjectivist 
approach to beliefs, which emphasizes the importance of surpassing the 
confines of existing social provisions/norms.  
Radical Structuralist  This approach is also based on Sociology of radical change but, It has a 

Radical Humanist

which is tailor-made to acquire knowledge of those objects. 

Hitherto, this paper has discussed about the general theoretical perspectives to philosophy and 

its  paradigms.  The  following  sections  discusses,  the  Dominant  paradigm  in  Finance  (B), 

Paradigmatic position of in Market contagion research (C), Other paradigms in Finance (D), 

Interpretivist approach to Market contagion (E) and Conclusion (F). 

(B) The Dominant paradigm in Finance 

The Research in finance can be broadly classified into study of corporate finance and financial 

markets. Findings in these researches has provided inputs for bringing change in the industrial 

practices,  policy  regulations  and  in  understanding  the  causal  effects  of  variety  of  market 

variables under study.  A large body of research in finance involves developing theories, stating 

hypothesis and building models around them which are then empirically tested.   

Philosophy of science and theory of society are the foundations on which finance theories 

are developed (Ardalan, 2003).  Until the late 1980s rational behaviour, perfect market and 

free  information  availability  were  the  keystone  (ideal  assumptions)  of  major  financial 

theories. When an investor/ decision maker seeks maximisation of his utility defined over a 

number of arguments, he is said to have behaved rationally (Ryan, 2002).   Perhaps, these 

assumptions resemble the Platonic realism as explained by Platos theory of Forms/ideals. 

Asset  pricing  (Merton,  1975,  Black  and  Scholes,  1973),  portfolio  construction  (Markowitz, 

1952, Sharpe, 1964, Ross, 1976), investment  decisions, capital  structure  and cost  of  capital 

(Modigliani and Miller, 1958), efficient market hypotheses (Malkiel and Fama, 1970) are some 

of the major theories in finance based on which legion of empirical work has been conducted. 

New age financial theories are mostly based on realism and Walrasian general equilibrium 

with  research  using  scientific  methodology  under  positivism  (Findlay  and  Williams,  1980).  

Realism is the ontological view of what we know and that, reality is independent of human 

perceptions. 

Nevertheless, empirical study provided evidence of several anomalies in the theories that could 

not be explained with the aforesaid assumptions alone. This is because of the abstraction of the 

real  world  in  formulating  these  theories.  Thus,  in  the  1980s,  researchers  started  looking  at 

theories based on irrational behaviour (Shefrin and Statman, 1985, Bondt and Thaler, 1985), 

imperfect  markets(Reynolds,  1938,  Levy,  1978,  De  Long  et  al.,  1990,  Amihud  and 

Mendelson, 1986, Jensen and Meckling, 1976) and explanations of theory of firm based on 

managerial  behaviour  and  ownership  (Jagannathan  and  Wang,  1996).  In  imperfect  markets 

information flow may not be free to all investors, returns and asset prices may be influenced 

by random noise trading 

Following  LeRoy  and  Porter  (1981)  and  Thaler  (1993),  the  question  of  whether  mass 

psychology was an important factor behind the stock valuations in the market was asked by 

Shiller (1984). This line of thought is a shift in the dominant metaphorical structure, however, 

debates are mostly with in these structures and no clear shift from functionalist paradigms are 

observed.  A metaphor serves to generate an image for studying a subject. This image provides 

the basis for detailed scientific research that attempts to discover the extent to which features 

of the metaphor are found in the subject of inquiry (Ardalan, 2003). 

In  their  exploratory  analysis,  McGoun  (1992),  Kavous  Ardalan  (2000,  2001,  2003,  2004, 

2007), Gendron and Smith-Lacroix (2015), find that core of finance research (Theories, PhD 

program,  Conferences,  Journals)  lack  diversity  in  paradigms  and  is  dominated  by  the 

functionalist paradigm.  

Positivist  paradigm  focuses  on  facts,  looks  for  causality  and  fundamental  laws  by  reducing 

phenomena  to  its  simplest  elements.  Emphasis  is  on  formulating  hypotheses  and  testing  in 

order  to  operationalise  concepts  so  that  they  can  be  measured  (OGorman  and  MacIntosh, 

2015).  

The general paradigmatic structure of research in finance is as follows  

  Ontology  Financial research is inclined towards objectivism (Ryan, 2002, Jayne, 2010). 

Objectivism is seeing the world as a concrete structure (Morgan and Smircich, 1980) and 

it is  external to the researcher (Mark Saunders, 2015).  

  Epistemology - Social science research epistemologies are Positivism, Critical Realism1, 

Action  Research  and  Interpretivism  (OGorman  and  MacIntosh,  2015).    Most  of  the 

research in finance tends towards use of precise and highly specific data for analysis, and 

use of scientific method (systematic observation, collection of data, developing  theories 

and testing hypothesis) for deduction. Probably, that is why positivism is more popular. 

According to OGorman and MacIntosh (2015), objective ontology typically concur well 

with positivist epistemology.  

  Human Nature  Under the cause and effect mechanism, every individual interact with 

one another and with the society (Bettner,McGoun and Robinson, 1994)

Title: RES 000-23-1108: Research Report, PDF: Research_papers_50\5822report.pdf
Header: Background 
The  fear  of  crime  is  an  enduring  research  topic.  Since  the  1960s  in  the  USA  and  the 
1970s  in  the  UK  there  has  been  a  growing  belief  that  public  anxieties  about  criminal 
victimisation are a widespread feature of modern life (Stanko, 2000). Underpinning this 
belief is an ever-expanding corpus of work on the fear of crime, emotional reactions to 
crime, or anxieties about crime; indeed a telling indicator of the political significance of 
this  topic  is  the  fact  that  questions  relating  to  the  fear  of  crime  are  one  of  the  few 
consistent elements of the 1982-2006/07 British Crime Surveys (BCS).  

Yet a number of authors have expressed concerns about the measurement of the fear of 
crime (Farrall et al, 1997 summarise this literature). Two studies have suggested that the 
fear of crime has been (at best) misrepresented and (at worst) exaggerated (Farrall et al., 
1997; Farrall & Gadd, 2004). Building upon best practice in survey research and question 
design,  an  earlier  ESRC  Award  (RES000220040)  designed  and  piloted  new  survey 
questions. The resulting data suggested that fears about crime were in fact less common 
than they were previously held to be (Farrall & Gadd, 2004). The current ESRC award 
(RES 000231108) sought to build upon the previous grant in a number of ways. First of 
all we aimed to confirm the findings from the pilot project in terms of the distribution of 
the fear of crime. Second we sought to explore what these new questions told us about 
the fear of crime and who was most likely to report having experienced it.  

Third, we tested a new conceptualisation which explored both the experiential element of 
the fear of crime (how do emotional responses to risk manifest in peoples daily lives?) 
and  the  expressive  element  (what  interpretative  processes  drive  public  concerns  about 
crime?).  On  the  one  hand,  our  task  was  motivated  by  previous  difficulties  with  the 
measurement  of  the  fear  of  crime:  survey  questions  have  been  questioned  for  their 
accuracy  and  reliability  in  identifying  the  everyday  experiences  of  crime,  leading  some 
criminologists  to  argue  that  the  measures  unwittingly  exaggerate  the  extent  to  which 
worries manifest as daily routines. On the other hand, a lack of theoretical sophistication 
in much of the quantitative research in this topic has bracketed out the social and cultural 
significance of crime and criminal threat.  

Our conceptualisation differentiated between those who worry as part of their everyday 
lives  and  those  who  have  a  more  diffuse  sense  of  anxiety  and  need  for  caution.  Our 
project  also  investigated  whether  the  experience  of  fear  (whether  this  was  concrete 
moments of worry or some more diffuse anxiety about risk and security) was explicably 
situated  in  peoples  understanding  of  their  social  and  physical  environment   
understandings  that  were  themselves  shaped  by  broader  values  and  concerns  regarding 
authority, law and order and long-term social change.  

This  conceptualisation  of  the  fear  of  crime,  as  well  as  resonating  with  qualitative 
accounts  of  crime-fears  (for  example,  see  Ditton  and  Bannister,  1997),  forced  us  to 
consider a number of conceptual questions. For example, what are we to make of people 
who say they are very worried about crime, but have not actually felt worried recently, as 
found  by  Farrall  et  al.  (1997)?  We  hypothesised  that  this  level  of  intensity  of  worry  is 
expressive, articulating a generalised sense of risk which is embedded in and expressive 
of a whole set of rich interpretations of social order and moral consensus. This is not to 
spirit  the  fear  of  crime  away.  Rather,  it  is  to  develop  a  more  subtle  definition  of  the 
construct, taking seriously the idea that anxieties about crime often operate to express a

range  of  anxieties  about  other  social  issues.  It  was  through  these  lenses  that  we 
approached the fear of crime.  

We had four Objectives:

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: Objectives 
1: To assess the replication and modifications of the measure developed by Farrall. 

To  be  achieved  via  a  comparison  of  the  questions  piloted  in  the  earlier  ESRC  award 
(which  simply  referred  to  crime)  with  those  from  the  BCS  (in  which  specific  types  of 
crime were identified: car crime, burglary and robbery). Our analysis suggested that the 
modifications had little impact on the distribution of answers (see Working Paper One). 

2: Compare old and new measures of the fear of crime. 

the 

that  whilst 

two  styles  of  questions  produced  similar 

Our aim at this point was to compare the variables associated or correlated with the old 
and new measures of the fear of crime. Our first step was to run bi-variate analyses. We 
found 
lists  of 
correlates/associates,  the  coefficients  were  always  greater  for  the  new  measures. 
Multivariate  analysis  provided  more  systematic  analyses.  It  showed  that,  controlling  for 
other  factors,  crime  levels  and  victimisation  experience  were  the  only  consistent 
predictors of the two different measures of the fear of crime. In some cases, gender was 
important  (robbery),  as  was  age  (new  measures  of  burglary  and  car  crime),  area-type 
(robbery),  ethnicity  (burglary)  and  social  class  (old  measures  of  car  crime).  But,  crime 
levels and victimisation experience were more highly correlated with our new questions 
compared  to  estimates  derived  from  standard  tools.  Working  Papers  Three  and  Four 
reported  on  this  in  more  depth.  Working  Paper  Seven  returned  to  the  issue  to  report 
definitive results.  

3: To explore the fear of crime in terms of Experiences and Expressions.  

This  was  achieved  via  the  creation  of  four  groups  of  respondents:  those  who  scored 
highly  on  both  measures  (those  who  worried  on  an  everyday  basis);  those  with  low 
scores  on  both  measures  (those  who  were  not  worried);  those  with  high  scores  on  the 
old  measures  but  low  scores  on  the  new  measures  (we  characterise  these  as  anxious 
since  they  report  some  level  of  concern  but  also  admit  that  they  do  not  ever  actually 
worry);  and  those  with  high  scores  on  the  new  measures  but  low  scores  on  the  old 
measures  (the  number  of  individuals  in  this  group  was  extremely  small  so  subsequent 
analyses  focussed  on  the  three  substantial  groups).  We  also  developed  a  model  (tested 
using structural equation modelling) which accounted for variations in levels and types of 
fear based on: crime experiences (e.g. victimisation); perceptions of risk; concerns about 
neighbourhood disorder, cohesion and collective efficacy; individual socio-demographic 
characteristics; and wider social and economic factors. This model was developed from 
existing theories of the fear of crime (Working Paper Five) and tested on qualitative data 
(Working Paper Six) and quantitative data (Working Paper Seven).  

4: To use this knowledge to inform a number of groups in the UK (and beyond) about 
the fear of crime and its dispersion across the population.  

This has been achieved through the activities listed below under the headings Activities 
and  Outputs.  In  short,  we  have  held  one  seminar  for  an  international  audience  of

crime (using standard indicators) and other topics related to criminal justice, respondents 
got one of four random follow-up sections. Our new questions were fielded to half the 
respondents who answered follow up D (n = 4,448). Three offence types were specified: 
burglary, robbery and car crime.

Results 
Four phases of work were planned (see Objectives). Starting with a confirmation of the 
earlier  ESRC  award,  we  built  up  to  more  theoretically-informed  analyses.  Our 
conceptualisation  of  the  fear  of  crime  was  characterised  by  the  idea  that  fear  of  crime 
encapsulates  a  range  of  different  phenomena.  On  one  hand  there  are  those  fleeting 
experiences  which,  based  on  our  qualitative  research,  appeared  to  be  of  a  very  short 
duration, and were best described as transitory, infrequent and often very short-lived. On 
the  other  hand  when  respondents  (in  qualitative  research)  were  asked  to  discuss  their 
fears about crime, it appeared that their feelings about crime were more akin to a diffuse 
anxiety, articulated by our interviewees as the need to be careful and a general concern 
about the way society was heading2. These feelings did not seem to represent fears as 
such, but rather to represent opinions about societal-level change, the causes of this, and 

2 Anxieties about crime took other forms too: for example worrying on the part of others (i.e. expressing 
concern about crime and its effect on the elderly); worrying about others and their safety (vicarious anxiety) 
and  worrying  in  the  absence  of  direct  experience  or  threat  (it  would  be  terrible  if).  These  sorts  of 
anxieties were outlined in more detail in Working Paper One.

what can be done to limit the less desirable aspects of these changes. These concerns, as 
such, did not represent heart-stopping, terror-loaded moments when citizens feared for 
their  lives  or  the  integrity  of  their  home  and  possessions,  but  rather  represented  quite 
reasonable expressions of valid and not disinterested views on the society in which they 
live.  Working  Paper  One  outlined  the  distinction  between  these  two  types  of  fear  in 
greater detail (which we referred to being the experiential and expressive dimensions) 
and discussed how these could be captured in survey research.  

Working  Paper  One  also  reviewed  the  state-of-the-art  of  the  psychology  of  survey 
response  and  the  frequency  with  which  people  report  common  emotional  experiences. 
Our review of these issues led us to the conclusion that the questions designed as part of 
the  earlier  ESRC  award  best  capture  the  experiential  dimension  of  the  fear  of  crime 
(since these questions ask about specific episodes which have be fallen the respondent in 
the  recent  past).  By  contrast  the  older  style  of  survey  questions  mix  up  the  everyday 
worry  with  some  kind  of  fear  of  crime  which  does  not  manifest  in  concrete  visceral 
feelings  (since  these  survey  questions  ask  more  generalised  questions  and  elicit  from 
respondents something more akin to an attitude). 

Having outlined our approach to the fear of crime and its measurement, we presented 
some basic findings in Working Paper Three (Working Paper Two explored the origins 
of the fear of crime in the UK). According to standard measures, 35% of respondents 
were (fairly or very) worried about  robbery,  47%  about  burglary, and  45% about car 
crime. However, when asked whether they had worried once or more over the past year, 
16%  said  yes  over  robbery,  32%  over  burglary,  and  32%  over  car  crime.  Moreover, 
when asked how many times they had worried over the past year (if they had), only 2% 
of the sample had worried once a week or more about robbery, 4% over burglary, and 
4%  over  car  crime.  This  suggested  that  questions  about  the  frequency  of  worry  were 
measuring something more specific than questions about an overall intensity of worry; in 
many instances, standard indicators seemed to be tapping into something else  perhaps 
a  diffuse  anxiety  (Hough,  2004),  a  generalised  awareness  and  image  of  risk  (Jackson, 
2006),  or  even  a  condensation  of  broader  concerns  about  crime,  stability,  and  social 
change (Taylor and Jamieson, 1996; Girling et al. 2000; Farrall, 2006). 

Working  Paper  Four  then  cross-tabulated  respondents  answers  to  both  styles  of 
questions  and  examined  the  correlates  of  the  subsequent  fear  of  crime  groups.  Our 
thinking  developed  as  the  project  evolved:  we  returned  to  this  issue  in  Working  Paper 
Seven  where  we  reported  the  results  of  latent  class  analysis  (which  allowed  us  to 
empirically  identify  patterns  underlying  the  data).  Individuals  were  placed  into  one  of 
four  groups  according  to  their  scores  on  the  old  and  new  measures  (for  robbery, 
burglary, and car crime):  

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

54%  of  respondents  reported  not  being  worried  when  asked  either  type  of 
question.  These  people  appeared  to  be  protected  from  both  feelings  of  crime-
related anxiety and fearful episodes. We referred to them as the unworried.  

21% of the respondents reported no direct experiences of the fear of crime, but 
expressed some level of concern (ranging from mild to high levels) about crime 
when  asked  old-style  questions.  This  group  we  termed  the  anxious,  since  they 
worried about crime but did not appear to have experienced specific episodes of 
fear.

21%  reported  being  worried  when  asked  both  types  of  questions.  These  cases 
report both expressive fears and at least one episode of fear. These people, unlike 
the  unworried,  appear 
fearful  episodes  and,  perhaps 
understandably,  report  higher  levels  of  worry  about  crime.  We  referred  to  this 
group as the worried.  

to  experience 

4% had worried at least once a week. We named this group the frequently worried.  

These findings suggest that we have been able to more accurately distinguish those who 
experience fearful episodes from those who express anxieties  a goal promised by the 
earlier  ESRC-funded  project  (RES000220040).  Further  analysis  showed  this  new 
conceptualisation  of  the  fear  of  crime  had  substantive  implications,  specifically  that 
everyday worry reflected a more experiential and damaging phenomenon than anxiety:  

(cid:2) Respondents were asked whether they had ever felt in danger of physical attack 
by a stranger. 12% of our sample said yes. When cross-tabulated with the above 
groupings,  we  found  that  8%  of  the  unworried  said  yes,  9%  of  the  anxious 
said yes, 23% of the worried and 30% of the frequently worried; 

(cid:2) Respondents were also asked about the impact of crime on their quality of life. 
Amongst the unworried, 2% said that it did a great deal, 7% for the anxious, 
9% for the worried and 22% for the frequently worried. 

These groupings were then explored in greater depth (Working Paper Seven). We used 
multinomial logistic regression to identify the characteristics associated with membership 
of each of these categories. The anxious represented a group which was in the middle of 
society in terms both of their social position - a home-owning group, living in areas with 
low  levels  of  ethnic  variation,  high  levels  of  professional  workers  with  good  financial 
resources. Their experience of crime was also of the middling sort: they witnessed little 
of it, experienced less still, and lived in areas with low levels of deprivation and disorder. 
In  many  respects  the  group  of  people  we  referred  to  as  the  anxious  were  generally 
drawn from amongst the better off members of society. Working Paper Four dealt with 
some  of  the  possible  explanations  for  this,  including  middle  class  fear  of  falling 
(Ehrenreich, 1989), the encroachment of crime into middle class consciousness (Garland, 
2001), and the wider social and economic changes experienced in post-industrial nations 
since the end of the second world war (e.g. Offer, 2006).  

In  Working  Paper  Five  we  reviewed  the  literature  on  the  fear  of  crime  and  derived  a 
framework which drew together hitherto unconnected empirical and conceptual insights 
from the literature (Figure One). This model sought to bridge several levels of analysis. 
Beginning at the top left, our model began with ecological neighbourhood factors (which 
include  crime  levels,  deprivation  and  the  long-term  trajectory  of  a  community  and  its 
social  conditions),  existing  attitudes  towards  the  way  society  is  going  and  values  about 
normative and moral standards (including authoritarian attitudes towards crime and law 
&  order),  and  circulating  representations  of  crime  and  social  change.  Individuals  who 
live in high-crime neighbourhoods, who hold certain attitudes towards social conditions, 
and who attend and respond to circulating images of crime and danger, were expected to 
be more likely to see in their environment problems of disorder, cohesion, shared trust, 
and informal social controls. This is because, first, that local community is more likely to 
have  these  features,  and  second,  the  individual  will  typically  conclude  salient  disorderly 
and  problematic  features  from  otherwise  ambiguous  cues.  These  neighbourhood

concerns  shape  perceptions  of  risk  (which  include  judgements  of  likelihood,  control, 
consequence  and  the  vividness  of  risk)  and  emotional  responses  towards  those 
perceptions  (whether  this  be  a  more  diffuse  anxiety  or  explicit  moments  of  worry). 
Finally, direct and indirect experience of crime was expected to influence everyday worry 
but not anxiety about crime.  

Figure One: An integrative framework of the fear of crime 

Using  this  framework,  Working  Paper  6  drew  on  qualitative  data  from  two  previous 
ESRC-funded  projects,  one  conducted  in  Glasgow  (Farrall  et  al.,  1997),  the  other  in 
London  (Jackson,  2002).  In  terms  of  the  experiential  features  of  fear,  it  was  clear  that 
when asked whether they worry about crime, some interviewees conveyed short episodic 
memories  of  fear    which  were  grounded  in  the  specifics  of  time  and  place    such  as 
fleeting  occasions  when  they  feared  their  car  had  been  stolen  or  they  had  temporarily 
misplaced  a  possession.  Such  worries  typically  accompanied  clear  stimuli,  such  as 
footsteps behind you, or the sound of arguing voices. Moreover, worry was not the only 
response.  Interviewees  described  a  range  of  thoughts  and  feelings,  including  concern, 
awareness,  anxiety,  irritation,  anger  and  worry,  to  name  a  few.  In  short,  the  emotional 
pallet was broad, demonstrating the diversity and complexity of emotional responses to 
crime.  

By contrast, interviewees also talked about a kind of emotional concern about crime and 
threat that was irreducible to concrete feelings of danger and risk. This concern seemed 
more  akin  to  anxiety  and  less  grounded  in  day-to-day  experience.  When  pressed  to 
describe  their  thoughts  and  feelings,  individuals  found  it  difficult  to  locate  specific 
emotional  experiences;  instead  they  often  talked  about  the  need  to  be  careful  and 
responsible,  about  the  erosion  of  cohesion  and  their  experience  of  distrust  when 
considering  their  neighbours  and  society.  Broader  shifts  in  society  were  identified  by 
participants  as  influencing  their  emotional  responses  to  crime.  Some  participants 
resented  the  imposition  of  responsibilisation  policies  and  the  fortress  mentality  that  a 
perceived growth in crime rates had necessitated. Others lamented the corrosive affects 
of poverty and inequality as contributing to social tensions as well as public sensibilities 
about  crime  and  disorder.  Still  others  talked  about  the  failure  of  the  police  and 
governments to protect them and uphold the law. When these agencies appear weak and 
powerless public anxieties seemed to become amplified.

As others have found (Girling et al., 2000) when our interviewees talked about crime they 
also  often  talked  about  place,  and  specifically,  their  social  and  physical  environment. 
There was recognition that a clean and tidy space was important to ones sense of safety 
and indicative of a healthy place to live. Other respondents listed various local disorders 
(persistent  graffiti,  vandalism,  youths  always  hanging  around  and  littering  or  destroying 
property) as a particularly unpleasant and unsettling feature of their environment. Indeed, 
for  some  respondents  these  minor  but  nevertheless  persistent  disorders  had  a  potent 
impact  on  their  perceptions  of  the  neighbourhood.  Such  misdemeanours  affected  how 
they felt in relation to their environment because they were interpreted as indices of the 
level of safety and cohesion afforded to a particular area.  

Interviewees also talked about the role and value of social bonds. Topics herein included 
how  members  of  the  community  relate  and  support  each  other  (or  not);  the  informal 
control provided by the local population; and the identification and social production of 
particular problem populations. Unsurprisingly, community for these respondents was 
something that had been an important form of social organisation and provoked a strong 
emotional  pull.  However,  respondents  were  keenly  aware  of  risks  posed  to  these 
bonds; local people busier, less well known to their neighbours and less likely to remain 
in  one  area,  community  cohesion  was  being  replaced  by  more  negative  influences, 
namely materialism and individualism. Cognate worries about the breakdown of family-
life were also voiced. While in the past, families were said to have provided an extended 
network,  families  and  communities  were  perceived  to  have  changed  dramatically  and 
become more atomised. These types of cultural shifts highlight a lost time for some of 
the  older  respondents,  and  with  it  their  own  sense  of  belonging,  as  these  changes  are 
wrapped up in their own personal histories and their anticipated concerns for the future. 
As  community  cohesion  wanes  (perceived  or  otherwise)  and  as  members  of  the  local 
population  become  less  recognisable  to  one  another,  the  creation  and  prominence  of 
suspicious  characters  or  problem  populations  emerges.  There  were  plenty  of  stories 
about  local  individuals  or  categories  of  people  and  respondents  attributed  much  of  the 
areas  petty  crime  to  indigenous  sources,  especially,  young  people,  drunks  and  drug 
addicts. These groups also presented long-term dangers, in terms of causing anti-social 
behaviour  or  crime  which  could  restrict  the  aspirations  of  other  members  the 
community.  Discussions  also  focused  on  more  diffuse  worries,  about  the  loss  of  a 
cultural and moral order.  

In Working Paper 7 we returned to BCS data and included data from a local crime survey 
conducted  by  Jackson.  In  both  datasets  we  used  structural  equation  modelling  to  test 
mediational  models.  Findings  confirmed  that  concerns  about  neighbourhood  disorder 
and  social  cohesion,  as  well  as  judgements  of  risk,  were  important  in  explaining 
emotional  response  to  crime-risk  (both  everyday  worry  and  anxiety  about  crime). 
Moreover, concerns and judgements mediated the impact of neighbourhood crime levels 
and long-term social change on perceptions of risk and subsequent emotional response. 
Put another way, perceived risk and worry about crime were both embedded in concerns 
that members of the local neighbourhood were refusing to submit to the rules or rights 
of  others,  that  social  conditions  were  failing  to  encourage  citizens  to  treat  others  with 
respect, that the physical and social environment was somehow lacking.  

The  local  crime  survey  was  designed  in  such  a  way  that  all  respondents  lived  in  a  very 
similar  area,  meaning  that  one  could  investigate  why  different  individuals  come  to 
different conclusions about relatively homogeneous surroundings. Investigating the data, 
we found that those individuals who tended to judge ambiguous cues as disorder (and to

associate this with problems of social cohesion and criminal threat) were also those who 
(a) were concerned with the pace and direction of local social change (specifically, about 
neighbourhood breakdown and the decline of community cohesion) and (b) believed that 
discipline  and  morality  were  on  the  wane.  In  other  words,  broader  social  and  political 
attitudes  and  anxieties  shaped  first-order  judgements  of  disorder.  These  findings 
support  two  ideas.  First,  both  types  of  the  fear  of  crime  express  a  set  of  lay  diagnoses 
about  neighbourhood  breakdown  and  stability.  Second,  broader  social  anxieties  are 
locateable in specific aspects of neighbourhood disorder and social decay. 

In summary, and looking across the variety of data that we have brought to bear on our 
stated research problem, our study found that what has been previously been identified 
as fear of crime can usefully be carved up into two phenomenon: everyday worry about 
crime (which is relatively rare and typically affects those who live in high crime areas and 
who  have  direct  and  indirect  experience  of  crime)  and  anxiety  about  crime  (which  is 
more widespread and typically affects those who lead more protected lives). Moreover, 
people do not separate out the issue of crime from issues of cohesion, collective efficacy, 
social  change  and  tension:  rather  than  being  about  an  irrational  sense  of  crime,  fear 
(whether  it  is  everyday  worry  or  anxiety)  expresses  and  distils  lay  diagnoses  about 
neighbourhood breakdown and stability and the violation of social rules. We have shown 
that  both  types  of  fear  are  strongly  related  to  anxieties  about  neighbourhood  order, 
cohesion,  collective  efficacy  and  trust;  these  local  and  locateable  anxieties  are  also 
associated  with  broader  and  more  diffuse  societal  concerns  about  moral  order  and  the 
norms and bonds that bind us.   

The fear of crime is a broader token of cultural preoccupation (Garland, 2001). It is an 
emblem of moral outrage and censure, wrapped up in diagnoses of a society with shifting 
moral standards, loosening pressures to conform, and broader uncertainties amid rapidly 
changing  societies.  Crime  has  become  intertwined  in  the  public  mind  with  the  less 
dramatic  but  more  everyday  matters  of  social  cohesion,  consensus,  and  relations. 
Concerns  about  crime  seem  to  be  driven  not  just  by  aspects  of  risk  perception  and 
circulating mass-media images of frightening and unsettling events, but also by everyday 
signs of social stability and moral order. Indeed such concerns may, at the final analysis, 
be  just  as  much  about  concern  about  community  and  moral  outrage  as  it  is  about 
crime and risk per se.

A  team  at  the  Metropolitan  Police,  led  by  Professor  Betsy  Stanko,  have  also  started  to 
use  the  same  question  in  METPAS  (Metropolitcan  Police  Public  Attitude  Surveys). 
These  are  monthly  surveys  used  to  track  changes  in,  amongst  other  things,  the  fear  of 
crime.  One  line  of  research  is  to  explore  the  impact  of  particular  criminal  events  on 
expressive and experiential fear levels.  

Researchers  at  Leicestershire  County  Council  adopted  the  questions  we  developed  and 
have  inserted  these  into  a  number  of  surveys.  Their  results  (Adamson,  2007)  broadly 
support our own findings vis-a-vis the levels of experiential and expressive fears and the 
associates  of  the  anxious    who  appeared  to  hold  negative  views  about  social  and 
economic change.  

At  the  dissemination  conference  we  held  (June  2007),  a  number  of  researchers  and 
practitioners working in local government expressed support for the approach adopted 
and wanted to know more about the survey questions for their own use.

Header: ABSTRACT 
This  research  work  describes  the  first  work-package  of  an  exploratory  study,  which 
examined a group of elementary school teachers beliefs (representations) about digital 
technology in the French Polynesian context. The major objective of the study was to 
provide  teacher  education  programmes  with  research-based  information  about  the 
primary  school  teachers  beliefs  and  practices  about  digital  technology.  The  study 
based its theoretical assumptions about teacher beliefs on the social representations 
theory and its research design on the grounded theory. The data were collected via 
interviews using theoretical sampling and theoretical saturation methods. Interviewing 
and analysis procedures were implemented concurrently through the systematic use 
of  coding  and  iterative  analysis  processes.  Research  results  indicated  that  internal 
factors such as interest in technology, teachers DT skills and external factors such as 
support  from  administrators  and  technical  maintenance  played  key  roles  in  shaping 
teachers DT practices.

Header: INTRODUCTION 
The Internet, digital tools, and technologies for processing information and communicating are developing with 
remarkable speed. Digital technology (DT) tools have become cheaper, mobile and more accessible for everyone. 
They are evolving fast and spreading into individuals personal living space and altering social habits, interaction 
types, and culture. Nowadays, the use of DT in the classroom is considered indispensable and schools in many 
countries provide students with digital tools and portable PCs. However, despite the increase in access to DT and 
technology training, DT tools are not being used sufficiently enough to support student learning. The exponential 
development of DT and the subsequent demand for its integration in education exert pressure on teacher education 
programmes to incorporate technical, didactic and pedagogical training in their curricula. 

The  French  Polynesian  society  is  not  excluded  from  this  influence,  and  more  and  more  French  Polynesian 
schools  are  equipped  with  digital  tools.  Since  2010,  with  the  installation  of  the  underwater  fibre  optic 
communication  cable,  which  has  connected  French  Polynesia  to  Hawaii,  the  broadband  internet  has  been 
omnipresent in French Polynesian society. In 2015, an educational project called  Digital Plan for Education, was 
launched by the French Ministry of Education. This project reinforced the French Polynesians wish for the creation 
of a Digital School. In recent years, the French Polynesian Ministry of Education has demonstrated a genuine desire 
to integrate DT into educational practices and made significant efforts to equip schools with digital material. The 
French  Polynesian  ministry  of  education  aims  at  endowing  all  year  7  (6eme)  and  year  8  (5eme)  middle  school 
students with personal mobile equipment until the year 2019, and targets at generalizing the implementation of DT 
in all middle school classes. This endowment programme will also include primary schools upon their submission 
of a project. Since the endowments are often provided upon presentation of a pedagogical project, teaching advisors 
(TA) that are specialized in Information and Communication Technologies in Education (ICTE) have the task of 
training their colleagues in the development of such projects. This new endowment programme is also backed up 
with a large project that aims at providing teachers with pedagogical training on DT.

Contribution of this paper to the literature 
  This  study  is  based  on  a  social-psychological  stance  and  explores  teachers  DT  beliefs  using  the  social 
representations theory, which is a fairly new theoretical perspective for many international researchers. 
  The study provides a step-by-step grounded theory research framework suitable for any DT belief study in 

any educational setting. 

  The study bases its research focus on the results obtained in previous DT studies and uses these elements in 

its research frame to further investigate them. 

Figure 1. Research plan and work-packages 

The ultimate objective of the present study is to provide teacher education programmes with research-based 
information about the primary school teachers representations and practices about DT. The study attempted to 
find answers to the following questions: To what extent do teachers know about digital tools? How do they use 
them  in  their  classroom?  How  does  the  use  of  digital  tools  change  teaching  practices  and  interactions  in  the 
classroom? What is the added value of these tools for learning? How do teachers feel about using these digital tools 
in their practices?  

This work employed a three-phase research paradigm. The present paper deals only with the work-package 1. 
During the first work-package (see Figure 1), the researchers explored a group of elementary school teachers and 
teaching advisors representations of digital tools using face-to-face interviews.  

The  second  work-package  is  still  in  progress  and  will  be  available  for  the  symposium  Research  Days  in 
Education under the theme Innovative pedagogies and new technologies in education which will take place at 
the  University  of  French  Polynesia,  in  May  2018.  During  the  second  work-package,  the  researchers  aimed  at 
maximizing the participant variation by extending the interviews to teaching inspectors and trainee teachers. 

In the last work-package, which has not yet started, the researchers aim to carry out classroom visits and use 
video-recorded  data  to  examine  teachers  practices  and  conditions  at  schools.  The  third  package  will  employ 
classroom  observations  and  video-recorded  lessons,  which  were  gathered  during  an  extensive  project  called 
Pratiques  Educatives  Enseignantes  et  Parentales  en  Polynesie  (PrEEPP-Teachers  and  Parents  Educational 
Practices  in  Polynesia).  The  project  took  place  between  2014  and  2017  and  was  funded  by  the  following 
organizations:  Ministre  des  Outre-Mer  (Ministry  of  Overseas  France),  Universit  de  la  Polynsie  Franaise  (The 
University  of  French  Polynesia),  Vice-rectorat  de  la  Polynsie  franaise,  and  the  ESPE  de  lAcademie  de  Guadeloupe. 
During this extensive project, a large, elementary school level, classroom corpus was gathered from five French 
Polynesian archipelagos.

Significance of the Study 

Relevant literature on DT for education has suggested that enabling a lasting and efficient use of technology 
can  only  be  promoted  by  adapting  teacher  training  programmes  to  teachers  needs,  learning  contexts  and 
conditions. The influence of teachers beliefs on adoption and integration of DT in education has been a concern for 
many researchers (e.g., Abbitt, 2011; Brush, Glazewski, & Hew, 2008; Ertmer, 2005; Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 
2010; Ertmer, Ottenbreit-Leftwich, Sadik, Sendurur, & Sendurur, 2012; Steiner & Mendelovitch, 2017). 

  This study contributes to the existing DT literature by looking at it from the teacher belief perspective. The 
novelty of the present study is that it looks into teacher beliefs using the social representations theory. The 
social  representations  theory  is  a  well-established  theory  in  French  social  psychology.  However,  this 
perspective is novel to many international readers.  

  Although the study treats the DT issue in a French Polynesian context, it uses a specific research design 
(grounded theory approach) and some inquiry techniques that could be adopted in any educational setting. 
The researchers explain the research methodologies in a step by step manner and provide a well-defined 
research framework.  

  The present study bases its focus of scrutiny on research driven elements which are considered as central in 
any educational setting. A significant number of research studies have argued that the benefits of digital 
tools and technologies depend, to a large extent, on a) teachers representations, b) conditions available at 
schools, and c) teachers digital and pedagogical competencies (Cuban, Kirkpatrick, & Peck, 2001; Ely, 1999; 
Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2010; Ertmer et al., 2012). This study provides a framework showing how 
these aspects can be investigated.

Header: THEORETICAL STANCE & LITERATURE REVIEW 
This section provides a brief overview of the literature about the social representations theory (SRT), research 
done  on  teacher  beliefs  (representations)  about  adoption  and  integration  of  DT  in  teaching,  and  the  grounded 
theory method (GTM). First, a brief account of SRT (Moscovici, 2000a, 1988) is provided by focusing on the concept 
of  representations,  their  construction  and  their  significance  on  individuals  thinking  and  actions.  Then  a  short 
review of research on digital technologies for education is presented in association with teacher representations. 
Finally,  GTM  and  the  research  procedures  followed  in  this  qualitative  research  inquiry  are  depicted  (Glaser  & 
Strauss, 1994; Strauss & Corbin, 1990). 

Social Representations Theory 

The concepts and theoretical perspectives about social representations were first developed by French scholars, 
who  were  specialized  in  social  psychological  research.  However,  the  theory  has  received  international 
acknowledgement and utilized by different scholars from diverse backgrounds (see Deaux & Philogne, 2001). The 
research paradigms used in this domain of inquiry bear parallelism with traditions in social constructionism and 
symbolic interactionism (Jovchelovitch, 2001). French sociologist Emile Durkheim (1898) was the first scholar who 
used the representations notion. However, social psychologist Serge Moscovici was the one who considered this 
concept as a phenomenon for the first time and developed it into a theory (Philogne & Deaux, 2001). Other French 
scholars such as Jodelet (1989), Doise, Clmence and Lorenzi-Cioldi (1992), and Abric (1994), also contributed to 
the elaboration of the concepts of SRT and the development of its theoretical framework.  

The term representations has been used to refer to common knowledge, self-beliefs, cultural beliefs such as 
stereotypes,  collective  cognitions,  attitudes,  prejudices,  images  and  so  forth  (Moscovici,  2000a,  1988).  Social 
representations are both individual and social and they carry the trademarks of society to which individuals belong 
(Abric, 1994). The term representations has been used to refer to common knowledge, self-beliefs, cultural beliefs 
such  as  stereotypes,  collective  cognitions,  attitudes,  prejudices,  images  and  so  forth  (Moscovici,  2000a). 
Representations can be in the form of contradictory ideas or thoughts in fragments that are linked to other everyday 
concepts (Abric, 1993). Despite their frivolous appearance representations are socially forceful and they help form 
a  common  understanding  among  people  who  belong  to  a  group  (Moscovici,  2000a,  1988;  Duveen,  2000). 
Representations form a base on which individuals (co)construct other beliefs and cognitions. In return, these beliefs, 
cognitions,  common  knowledge,  perceptions  or  aggregate  of  all  these  common  understandings  influence  the 
decisions individuals make and actions they take (Abric, 1993, 1994; Gabillon, 2005; Moscovici, 2000b, 1988). Other 
theories in psychology and educational psychology are also supportive of the notion that beliefs (e.g., self-beliefs, 
self-efficacy beliefs, representations) have an impact on individuals attitudes, motivations and consequently on 
their actions (e.g., Krause, Pietzner, Dori, & Eilks, 2017; Pajares, 1992; Weiner, 1980, 1985). SRT has been applied to 
a broad array of topics and domains ranging from education, health, science, new technology, identity and so forth 
(Abric, 1994; Bauer & Gaskell, 1999; Christidou, Dimopoulos, & Koulaidis, 2004; Gabillon, 2005, 2012).

Figure 2. Schematic representation of Moscovicis objectification process ( Gabillon , 2012, p. 197) 

According to Abric (1994), social representations precede and determine the flow of interaction, and they shape 
individuals  behaviours  and  practices.  Representations  are  considered  as  being  in  continuous  interaction  with 
context(s), subjects, and other social artefacts in individuals environments (Doise et al., 1992). This view holds that 
the initial representations the individual has about an artefact will determine the nature of future interaction the 
person will have with that artefact. Thus, how the person will make use of that artefact will, for the greater part, 
depend on the initial representation that the individual has of the artefact (Doise et al., 1992).  

Representations are not stable entities and can be (re)shaped through new experiences. Individuals may have 
positive or negative representations, and these representations can be influenced when new categories of ideas are 
formed through lived experiences. Moscovicis SRT is concerned with the process through which representations 
(i.e.  beliefs,  images,  ideas,  etc.)  are  produced,  transformed, and  transmitted  to  the  social world  (Duveen,  2000). 
Moscovici (2000a) maintained that the primary purpose of representations is to facilitate interpretations and form 
opinions. According to Moscovici (2000a, 2000b), comparing objects, ideas, individuals, events and so forth leads 
people  to  create  classifications  and  link  them  to  a  prototype,  which  represents  a  category.  He  considered  this 
classification system more than just a simple means of grading and labelling discrete entities (e.g., persons, objects, 
events,  peoples  actions,  etc.).  Moscovici  (2000a,  2000b)  claimed  that  function  of  all  representations  is  to  turn 
something unfamiliar into something familiar.  

Moscovici  defined  this  process  as  composed  of  two  complementary  and  interdependent  mechanisms: 
Anchoring  and  objectification  (Moscovici,  2000a).  The  first  mechanism,  anchoring  is  the  process  whereby  the 
unfamiliar is absorbed into a known category. The second mechanism aims to objectify the unknown, that is, to 
turn something abstract into something almost concrete, which already exists in the individuals physical world 
(Moscovici,  2000a,  2000b).  In  other  words,  anchoring  and  objectification  is  a  process  whereby  the  individual 
transforms the unfamiliar into a more significant and easily comprehensible image. Moscovici (2000a) argued that 
such a process reassures and comforts people and re-establishes a sense of continuity. He sustained that during this 
process the familiar category often remains unaltered and the newly formed concepts, which are connected to this 
main category, are absorbed into this dominant category (see Figure 2). 

According to Abric (1993), social representations have contradictory characteristics. They can be both rigid and 
flexible, and stable and changeable. To explain this phenomenon, he elaborated the concepts used in Moscovicis 
objectification process and developed the central core (central system) theory as a sub-theory of SRT (Abric, 1993). 
Abric explained that each belief is composed of a stable category to which peripheral schemes are connected. He 
named  the  stable  category  as the  central  core.  He  maintained  that  ideas,  metaphors,  images  form networks  of 
related beliefs that are connected to one another around a core belief. He explained that this core belief stands for a 
prototype.  In  SRT  the  central  core  is  considered  as  a  dominant  representation  which  is  resistant  to  change.  A 
peripheral  representation,  on the  other  hand,  is a newly  formed  representation, which  is more  flexible and  less 
resistant  to  change.  According  to  Moscovici  (2000a),  central  cores  are  social  representations  (i.e.  social/cultural

EURASIA J Math Sci and Tech Ed 

beliefs) which are created in society by members of that society. Abric (1993) stated that core representations express 
permanence  and  uniformity  and  they  dominate  peripheral  schemes.  Whereas,  peripheral  schemes  express 
variability and diversity. He maintained that the central core is  stable, coherent, consensual and historically 
marked  and  the  peripheral  scheme  is  far  more  sensitive  and  determined  by  the  immediate  context 
characteristics. (Abric, 1993, p. 76). He also added that peripheral schemes support heterogeneity of the group and 
allow the integration of individual experiences, adaptation to concrete reality and content differentiation. 

Teacher Representations and the Link between the Use of DT 

Several studies examined the relationship between teachers representations and adoption and integration of 
technology in teaching and investigated the factors that influenced teachers practices (Abbitt, 2011; Brush et al., 
2008; Ertmer et al., 2012; Pelgrum & Plomp, 2008; Pilkington, 2008; Prestridge, 2012; Voogt & Knezek, 2008). These 
studies employed both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies and collected data essentially through 
questionnaires, interviews, and observations. In many of these studies, teachers beliefs (representations) and the 
use of DT tools for education were investigated in relation to: a) teachers technical and pedagogical competencies, 
b)  teacher  development  and  preservice  education,  d)  availability  and  management  of  DT  tools,  e)  evolution  of 
teaching practices and so forth.  

Many research studies that examined teachers representations used the term beliefs (e.g., self-efficacy etc.). The 
results obtained from these studies have indicated that there are correlations between teachers representations and 
their practices and that teachers representations, skills, and attitudes are interdependent (Abbitt, 2011; Brush et al., 
2008; Summers, 1990; Steiner & Mendelovitch, 2017). Many researchers sustained that, negative representations, 
due to lack of knowledge about digital tools, would have a direct consequence on teachers emotions and attitudes 
(e.g., fear, reticence, caution, etc.) and would influence their confidence in using these tools. In contrast, positive 
representations would correlate positively with teachers feelings, attitudes and subsequently with their actions 
(Abbitt, 2011; Berney & Pochon, 2000; Ertmer et al., 2012; Felder, 1989; Prestridge, 2012; Rinaudo, 2002; Windschitl 
& Sahl, 2002, etc.). 

Research findings have indicated that teachers behaviours can be influenced more by their representations of 
an artefact than by the knowledge about the artefact in question, especially in cases when interaction with the object 
is minimal. However, regular interaction and subsequent experience resulting from this interaction can modify the 
individuals representations because this dynamic and reciprocal influence between representation and interaction 
generates a mutual evolution (Abric, 1993; Prestridge, 2012). Research outcomes obtained from a meta-aggregative 
analysis of 14 studies on integration of technology in education proposed that in association with regular use of 
technology,  teachers  often  change  their  classroom  practices  (Arnold,  Padilla,  &  Tunhikorn,  2009;  Tondeur,  van 
Braak, Ertmer, & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2017). Other research studies on teachers beliefs about DT also suggested 
similar links between teachers beliefs and their attitudes towards the use of digital technology (Abbitt, 2011; Brush 
et al., 2008; Ertmer, 2005; Windschitl & Sahl, 2002). 

Results obtained from different research studies have revealed strong links between teachers use or non-use of 
DT in teaching and their conceptions of student learning and (Riel & Becker, 2008). The results obtained from some 
studies  demonstrated  that  teachers,  who  believed  that  it  was  their  role  to  foster  collaborative  learning  and 
independent individual student work, tended to use DT more frequently (Windschitl & Sahl, 2002). Conversely, 
teachers who felt that they were required to teach what the curriculum stipulated had tendencies to avoid the use 
of digital tools. The outcome of these studies also indicated connections between teachers representations about 
their professional competencies and the integration of DT in their teaching. The results suggested that teachers who 
believed that using digital tools required a good command of technical skills (which they believed they did not 
have), avoided using DT with their students (Ertmer et al., 2012; Windschitl & Sahl, 2002).  

Some research results also indicated that teacher representations that consider digital tools as ordinary tools 
or technical instruments would not be conducive to the integration of DT for learner use. Teachers who see digital 
tools  no  other  than  simple  devices  will  not  take  a  reflexive  stance  that  favours  the  integration  of  such  tools  in 
classroom practices (Baron & Bruillard, 1996; Ertmer et al., 2012; Karsenti & Larose, 2005). Baron and Bruillards 
(1996) findings suggested that teachers who were still in training considered DT as not being indispensable as an 
educational tool in the teaching/learning of disciplinary knowledge. A decade later Aoud (2007) reported similar 
results. In Aouds study, the participants, who were also trainee-teachers, stated that they used digital tools more 
in  lesson  preparation  and  much  less  during  activities  with  their  students.  Bziat  (2012)  asserted  that  trainee 
teachers representations of DT are influenced by their previous experience as student users at school, and these 
representations influence their disposition regarding the use of DT in their classrooms. Thus, Bziat suggested that 
teacher education programmes should intervene on the representations of trainee teachers by introducing the use 
of DT as early as possible in teachers professional education. Results obtained from a study carried out by Wang, 
Ertmer, and Newby (2004) showed that teacher education programmes could influence preservice teachers beliefs,

and  therefore  their  confidence  in  becoming  efficient  technology  users  within  their  classrooms  if  such  teacher 
education programmes provide them with a vicarious learning experience. 

Grounded Theory Method 

The grounded theory method (GTM) was formulated by sociologists Glaser and Strauss in the late 1960s. This 
qualitative research approach originated within the symbolic interactionist school of psychology (Baker, Wuest, & 
Stern, 1992) and it is used to generate a comprehensive theory to understand social and psychological phenomena 
(see Glaser & Strauss, 1994; Strauss & Corbin, 1990, 1997). The research traditions used in this school of inquiry 
share similarities with practices employed in social constructionism and social psychology (Bryant, 2017; Strauss & 
Corbin, 1997). The symbolic interactionist perspective assumes that people are motivated to look for meaning in 
their behaviour and that they act in accordance with their subjective understanding of the situations in which they 
find themselves. GTM is used in disciplines that aim to discover significant aspects of human experiences, and it is 
employed to capture, understand, and explain lived experiences of people (Baker et al., 1992; Charmaz, 1996). GTM 
provides researchers with a series of logically consistent research techniques and strategies to conduct rigorous 
qualitative research studies. These interpretive research methods are especially suitable for studies that intend to 
discover participants meanings, perceptions, emotions, attitudes, beliefs and so forth. GTM is, inductive, iterative 
and an interactive inquiry which necessitates entering the participants world and gathering as complete accounts 
as possible (Charmaz & Belgrave, 2012).  

The terms which are associated with GTM are theoretical sampling, theoretical saturation, purposeful sampling, 
and coding (e.g., open and axial coding). Theoretical sampling is one of the central concepts of GTM. The term was 
introduced to the literature with the discovery of GTM by the sociologists Glaser and Strauss. Theoretical sampling 
is a data collection process with a primary objective of generating theory. During this process the analyst carries 
out a series of concurrent data collection and analysis procedures and decides what data to collect next. This process 
involves  collecting,  coding,  comparing,  linking,  and integrating  data  into  relevant  categories  (Glaser  &  Strauss, 
1994; Paill, 1994; Paill & Mucchielli 2003; Strauss & Corbin, 1990, 1997).  

Data  collection,  concurrent  comparative  analysis,  and  category  formation  procedures  continue  until  each 
category is saturated. In other words, the theoretical sampling processes end when the data collection procedures 
can  no  longer obtain  new  information and  the analysis  procedures  cease  to  generate new  categories  (Charmaz, 
1996). This stage is referred to as theoretical saturation, and this saturation point determines the definitive sample 
size (Becker, 1993; Becker & Stamp, 2005; Glaser & Strauss, 1994; Paill, 1994; Paill & Mucchielli 2003; Strauss & 
Corbin, 1990).  

In GTM sampling is carried out using specific procedures. Sampling procedures should not be confounded with 
theoretical  sampling,  which  is  sampling  for  theory  construction,  not  for  representativeness  of  a  given 
population,  to  check  and  refine  the  analysts  emerging  conceptual  categories.  (Charmaz,  1996,  p.  28).  When  a 
research project begins, based on the phenomenon the researchers intend to investigate, representative groups of 
individuals are selected. In GTM researchers go to groups from whom they can obtain rich information about issues 
crucial  to  the  purpose  of  the  research  (Corbin  &  Strauss,  1990;  Strauss  &  Corbin,  1990).  The  initial  purposeful 
sampling  is  usually  based  on  similarities  or/and  maximum  variation  principles  with  an  aim  of  obtaining  the 
maximum of information on the phenomenon in question and maximizing the representativeness of the primary 
data.  Initial  sampling  is  usually  based  on  similarities  principle,  and  the  researchers  select  a  group who  has  the 
characteristics that are shared by all members (e.g., social identity, occupation, educational background) and are 
representative of the phenomenon in question. Maximum variation is used when researchers desire to maximize 
the  variation  (e.g.,  age,  gender,  class,  etc.)  within  the  sample.  The  aim  of  maximum  variation  is  to  ensure  the 
presence of maximum variability within the primary data.  

Coding  is  the  central  inquiry  process  used  in  GTM.  Open  and  axial  coding  are  two  most  commonly  used 
analysis methods. Open coding is mainly used at the initial stages of the inquiry processes. It involves comparing 
ideas,  interactions,  events,  and  so  forth  for  similarities  and  differences  and  assigning  them  conceptual  labels 
(codes).  In  axial  coding,  categories  are  linked  to  their  sub-categories,  and  the  relationships  tested  against  data 
(Corbin & Strauss, 1990; Strauss & Corbin, 1990).

Header: METHODOLOGY 
The study was designed following the methods and procedures employed in GTM (see Glaser & Strauss, 1994; 
Strauss  &  Corbin,  1990).  Respecting  the  grounded  research  traditions,  the  researchers  started  the  analysis 
procedures as early as the first interview at the outset of the study. The data gathered through interviews were 
treated  by  applying  theoretical  sampling  and  theoretical  data  saturation  methods  using  concurrent  analysis 
schemes such as coding, sorting, linking, and forming categories (Glaser & Strauss, 1994; Strauss & Corbin, 1990). 
These research strategies enabled the formation of categories and a gradual construction of the definitive sample

size. The use of the theoretical saturation method also provided a means for triangulation by ensuring that the data 
represent all facets of the investigated phenomenon. Besides the theoretical sampling processes, the transcribed 
corpus  was  also  subjected  to  double  checking  by  the  interviewees  themselves.  That  is,  the  interviewees  were 
provided with the transcribed data, and they were asked to verify the content for accuracy and add information or 
correct the content if they felt necessary. 

Data Collection 

The  dataset  for  the  study  was  gathered  by  conducting  semi-directed  face-to-face  interviews,  and  the  data 
gathering and analysis procedures took place from April until the end of September 2017. Sixteen elementary school 
teachers from Tahiti, French Polynesia, participated in the research.  

Face-to-face interview technique is considered as a suitable data collection instrument in qualitative inquiry, 
and  its  use  is  recommended  by  the  proponents  of  GTM.  Interviews  provide  contextualized  and  in-depth 
information. Moreover, they are rich in discourse features such as emphasis, choice of vocabulary, repetitions, and 
social cues such as voice, intonation, body language and so forth. As such interviews provide a great deal of extra 
information that adds value to this qualitative research technique.  

Before  using  the  interview  questions  with  the  participants,  the  researchers  consulted  other  researchers 
opinions. The initial set of questions were tested with two teachers. These two preliminary interviews were not 
included in the actual research corpus. Following these two interviews, the researchers transcribed and analysed 
the  interview  data  and  readjusted  the  questions  and  consulted  two  other  researchers  to  check  the  adjusted 
questions. After some modifications, the final set of questions were formed and used with the other participants.  

To  minimize  the  interviewer bias  (e.g.,  personality,  experience,  etc.) and  to  provide  coherent  continuity,  the 
same  researcher  conducted  all  16  interviews.  The  interviewer  was  a  senior  researcher  who  had  experience  in 
qualitative research techniques, and during the interviewing process, she adapted the order and the content of the 
questions according to the statements obtained from the interviewees. The following interview questions were used 
in this first work-package: 

1.  When did you last use DT?  

2.  What do you think of your practices regarding the use of digital technology in class? 

3.  Do  you  think  that  the  use  of  digital  technology  could  influence  classroom  practices/interactions?  If  yes, 

how?  

4.  Do you like using digital technology in your practices?  

5.  Did you take part in an in-service training programme/event about digital technology? (If yes) How did 

you feel about it? (What do you think about it?) 

6.  Do you think that the acquisition of digital skills is necessary (for teachers and students)? 

To ensure the secure collection of the corpus and to avoid any technical problems, the recording of the interview 
corpus was carried out with two recording devices: a) a professional audio-recorder and b) a personal smartphone. 
The duration of the interviews ranged from 45 to 70 minutes. 

The  sampling  procedures  were  carried  out  at  three  levels  (see  Figure  3).  The  researchers  carried  out:  (i) 
purposeful sampling by applying the similarities and maximum variation principles to obtain rich information; 
and (ii) the theoretical saturation principle to determine the ultimate sample size.

This research study was concerned with elementary school teachers representations regarding the adoption 
and integration of DT in teaching, and the researchers looked for characteristics that were shared by all participants. 
Thus, the first level was concerned with constituting a group of participants who were the most representative of 
the phenomenon in question. During the first stage, the researchers used a purposive sampling method focusing 
on the similarities that characterized the group: The participants were selected on the bases of the following initial 
criteria: (i) similar educational background (i.e., lived and educated in French Polynesia); (ii) same cultural identity 
(i.e., French Polynesians); and (iii) similar work experience (i.e., worked in a French Polynesian primary school). 
After defining the characteristics regarding similarities, the researchers looked for differences within this uniform 
group  by  applying  the  principle  of  maximum  variation  (e.g.,  experience,  gender,  age,  and  responsibilities)  (see 
Table 1). 

The sample group size was determined through theoretical sampling processes. The maximum variation was 
established gradually during the theoretical sampling processes. As the interviewing progressed, sampling was 
fine-tuned and equalized based on differences (e.g., experience, gender, responsibility, etc.). The aim of this process 
was to ensure the presence of maximum variability within the primary data. The final participant number (after

EURASIA J Math Sci and Tech Ed 

Figure 4. The grounded theory methodologies the researchers followed 

theoretical sampling and theoretical saturation procedures) were 16 teachers: Eight men and eight women, eight 
teachers and eight teaching advisors, teachers within the age range of 33 to 50, and teachers with 11 to 23 years of 
teaching experience. 

Analysis Methods 

The  researchers  followed  the  steps  suggested  in  GTM:  coding,  categorization,  forming  of  broad  categories, 
linking, integration, and theorization (the researchers intend to delay the theorization stage until the completion of 
all  three  work-packages).  At  the  initial  stages,  the  researchers  used  open  coding  (vivo  coding),  and  as  they 
progressed in the analysis procedures, they discovered distinct ideas and labelled these properties to create new 
categories. After the initial coding procedures, using axial coding, they aggregated the lower level abstractions as 
sub-categories  and  then  through  iterative  inductive  processes  they  assigned  characteristics  to  different  data 
groups. Figure 4 illustrates the theoretical sampling, constant comparative analysis, coding, theoretical saturation 
and theorizing processes the researchers followed in the study. 

The researchers identified initial categories from the most frequent occurrences. Then, through axial coding, 
they identified new groups and other higher-level categories to which they progressively added new properties 
and  finally  grouped  all  these  categories  under  macro-categories.  The  categories  generated  via  this  study  were 
gathered  under  the  following  mega-categories:  (i)  teachers  representations  of  the  notion  of  DT;  (ii)  teachers 
statements about the use of DT; (iii) teachers statements about their students use of DT in class; and (iv) teachers 
stated feelings about the integration of digital tools in their teaching practices.  

After  the  eleventh  interview,  the  data  reached  saturation,  and  the  researchers  did  not  discover  any  new 
categories. However, they continued the interviewing processes until the sixteenth interview to establish maximum 
variation. Maintaining interviewing helped to establish a balance between the sub-categories and provided data to 
make  comparisons  between  different  participant  groups  (i.e.,  man/woman,  teacher/teaching  advisor, 
experienced/less  experienced,  etc.).  Relevant  literature  maintains  that  data  saturation  may  occur  before  12 
interviews (Guest, Bunce & Johnson, 2006). Griffin and Hausers (1993) study illustrated that with 20 interviews 
one could obtain 90% of the information that can be obtained with 30 or more interviews. In this first work-package, 
our study used a very homogenous sample size, and this may explain the saturation after eleven interviews. 

This article presents the preliminary results of a study which comprises three work-packages. In this first work-
package, the researchers did not attempt to theorize the categorized phenomena, and the results presented in this 
study have an exploratory character.

The Teachers Representations regarding the Notion of DT 

One of the objectives was to gather information about the teachers representations on the notion of digital 
technology. The interview corpus concerning this aspect was coded and examined through systematic comparison 
and  analysis  procedures  (i.e.,  iterative  inductive  processes).  Throughout  the  interviewing,  the  data  properties 
concerning the notion of DT, linked and integrated into different levels of abstractions and the sub-categories were 
organized into three hierarchical categories (see Figure 5). 

The  transcribed  data  revealed  that  the  respondents  did not  have  the  same  level  of  familiarity  with  DT.  The 
analysed corpus indicated that some teachers had very limited knowledge on DT both at personal and professional 
levels. Some teachers developed and refined their ideas with precise descriptions of some digital tools. However, 
some other teachers gave short responses in the form of basic concepts without developing their answers. It should 
be noted that the most cited concepts were about the commonly used materials and tools (e.g., the internet, email, 
social networks, etc.). The statements obtained from a few teachers indicated that they knew about varied technical 
tools, materials, applications, and sophisticated technical concepts that are reserved to competent users (e.g., web 
browsers, operating systems, UNIX, HTML, programming tools, etc.).  

More than half of the interviewees expressed a link between DT and the importance of its purposeful and ethical 

use:  

(...) behind each material; there is also an approach that must be used while teaching. (...) cannot use 
it as you do in traditional teaching, (...) the approach allows taking a professional stance (...) without 
also forgetting the whole ethical responsibility part about these uses.   

The Teachers Statements about the Use of DT  

In this macro-category, the researchers grouped the teachers statements about the use of digital tools and their 
classroom practices together. This mega-category also included teachers statements about classroom activities in 
which digital tools are used and the benefits of these tools. Figure 6 summarizes the teachers statements regarding 
the use of DT in their classrooms.

EURASIA J Math Sci and Tech Ed 

Figure 6. The teachers statements about the use of DT 

Most of the interviewees maintained that the integration of DT in teaching practices requires both technical and 
pedagogical knowledge and laborious work that demands extra preparation time. They repeatedly stressed the 
necessity of detailed preparation and foreseeing possible problems in advance:  

The preparation time of an activity is quite huge (...) everything has to be fixed and done in advance 
(...) in the computer room, if I do not think about and prepare everything in advance, () (if it is not 
done  properly)  they  (pupils)  will  drop  the  activity,  (...)  they  will  be  difficult  to  manage  (...)  it  is 
important that pupils are at ease when they start the tasks (...) is necessary that the students are all 
engaged in the activity, and maintain this attention during the duration of the activity. 

Some teachers also explained that in the classroom, they had to manage their students pedagogical needs, tools 

and other requirements about tasks simultaneously:  

()  if  we  do  not  give  clear  instructions  before  they  arrive  in  the  computer  room,  it  is  chaos  (...) 
everything  goes  in  every  way  ()  I  act  according  to  my  students  needs  (...)  demands;  there  are 
sometimes things that I cannot think of in advance. 

The teachers maintained that the wise use of digital tools necessitates modification of common teacher-learner 

interactions and teaching-learning practices:  

They  work  alone  ()  they  are  autonomous  ()  many  (students)  believe,  that  they  can  take  the 
information from the Net (Internet), and can use it without adapting, without appropriating really 
what they need to do () but as teachers, we must know how to use them (tools), and the teacher must 
teach the pupils, the children how to use these tools. 

The teachers also stated that the teachers presence during DT tasks is indispensable:  

Digital tools will never replace the teacher () the teacher-learner interactions are not the same as 
interactions between the learner and the tool () if theres no teacher to show him/her how to do it (...) 
the digital tool will not do the teachers work alone. 

The Teachers Statements about the Learners Use of DT in Class 

The  statements  which  were  about  the  uses  of  DT  by  learners  were  gathered  under  a  distinct  category  (see 

Figure 7).  

11 / 18 

 
 
 
 
 
Ailincai & Gabillon / Digital Technology Using a Grounded Theory Approach 

Figure 7. The teachers statements about the learners use of DT in class 

All teachers, stated that digital tools have advantages and are motivating for students:  

They (students) love it. They love it, () but because its not academic (...) its fun. They do not have 
computers at home. () They do not have IPads at home, not often () and in any case no internet 
() coming to the class and having a computer, its fun (...) like a game session Such tools can be 
very useful for the students with learning difficulties or special needs. 

Some teachers pointed out some positive aspects of DT tools regarding learner errors:  

(...) they are no longer blocked by fear of making an error. (...) being able to self-correct and to go back 
without  leaving  any  trace  (...)  its  always  tidy  (...)  no  mess  (...)  favours  enormously  students  with 
learning difficulties good for collaborative writing (...) with a computer, when one makes corrections, 
one produces a clean piece of work. There is no erasure, barring, erasing (...) For children, it still has 
another value to produce a clean piece of work ()  

Some teachers linked the issue concerning error correction to self-concept:  

I would like to mention its connection with childrens self-esteem (...) On tablets, I see that they are 
not afraid to be wrong when they write on a piece of paper, and when there is a mistake, they have 
difficulty in erasing it. They do not want to hand in their work anymore. There is a written trace () 
they  have  trouble  with  (...)  so  they  prefer  not  to  write  anything  because  they  are  not  sure  of  their 
answers, whereas on the tablet it is easily done (...) when it is wrong, they erase everything, and they 
can go back and revise (...) neither seen nor known (...) 

The  teachers also  described  in  which  situations  and  with which  school subjects  they  used  digital  tools.  The 
teachers  answers  indicated  that  they  used  digital  tools  and  software  applications  in  teaching  different  school 
subjects.  Table  2  provides  examples  through  which  the  teachers  described  how  they  used  these  tools  in  their 
teaching practices.

The Teachers Stated Feelings about the Integration of Digital Tools in Teaching Practices  

After forming general categories, the researchers regrouped the statements about the teachers feelings under 
two  broader  areas  and  presented  these  broader  categories  as  positive  and  negative  representations.  Thirty-six 
percent of the coded statements expressed favourable opinion towards DT and its use in the classroom. Sixty-four 
percent of the participants coded discourse contained some elements which pointed to problems. These negative 
statements, however, primarily expressed either difficulties that teachers faced and that needed to be resolved or 
reasons and explanations for non-use of digital tools. The researchers did not record any arguments against DT 
tools  or  their  use  in  the  classroom.  Although  the  expressions  that  mentioned  the  positive  aspects  of  digital 
technology came up in every interview, the arguments mentioning difficulties and problems were in the majority 
(see Table 3). 

Regarding  the  stated  difficulties  the  results  pointed  to  some  discrepancies  between  the  school  teachers  and 
teaching  advisors  viewpoints.  Especially,  about  the  issues  and  problems  related  to  teacher  training  these  two 
groups seemed not to share the same views (see Table 4). This discrepancy could be explained by their respective 
roles. Teaching advisors, apart from their teaching role, are also teacher mentors who provide teachers with support 
in their teaching in French education system. Table 4 presents some extracts from the interview corpus which point 
to discrepancies in these two groups statements.

Header: CONCLUSION 
This research work described how a study on teachers representations was shaped using GTM. The paper only 
dealt with the first work-package of a three-phase research study, which explored eight teachers and eight teaching 
advisors  discourse  on  DT  in  the  French  Polynesian  elementary  school  context.  GTM  aims  to  generate  theory 
through systematic analysis. However, this first work-package used this approach merely as a comprehensive data 
analysis method. The ideas, themes, categories emerged from the data illustrated the existence of prominent and 
thick  groups  of  representations  that  included  other lower  level  abstractions  which  pointed  to  variations  due  to 
different  experiences.  This  study  is  still  in  progress, and  the  phenomena  under investigation  have not  yet  fully 
explored.  In  the  coming  work-packages,  the  researchers  intend  to  enhance  maximum  variation  through  the 
inclusion  of  inspectors  and  trainee  teachers.  In  the  final  work-package,  the  researchers  will  analyse  the  video-
recorded  lessons  they  collected  from  five  different  French  Polynesian  archipelagos.  The  analysis  of  these  video 
recorded-data will focus on the examination of the use and non-use of digital tools, types of digital tools used in 
teaching, classroom interaction and organization types, and approaches used in classroom practices. 

The teachers statements indicated that DT was not being used in its highest capacity and even much less in the 
classroom  with  the  students.  The  results  suggest  that  all  interviewed  teachers  were  familiar  with  and  used  DT 
regularly to answer emails, communicate on social networks, and to prepare their lesson. However, only half of the 
participants stated that they used digital tools with their students in the classroom: (i) on a regular basis (n=3) and 
(ii) sometimes, with some specific activities (n=5). The other eight teachers stated that they used a digital tool (i) 
one time (n=5) and (ii) never (n=1). The data, indicated that there was a gap between the teachers use of digital 
tools  for  personal  purposes  (e.g.,  such  as  email  and  other  social  networking)  (n=16)  and  their  professional  use 
outside of class time (e.g., to prepare their lessons) (n=16) and the learners active use of technological tools in class 
(n=8). Our findings bear similarities with other research studies conducted on the topic (Cuban et al., 2001; Ertmer 
& Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2010; Palak & Walls, 2009; Prestridge, 2012; Russell, Bebell, ODwyer, & OConnor, 2003). 
Thirty-six  percent  of  the  coded  statements  expressed  positive  feelings  about  DT,  and  sixty-four  percent  of  the 
statements  expressed  problems.  However,  no  teacher  expressed  any  direct  refusal  or  rejection  concerning  the 
adoption  and  integration  of  DT  for  educational  purposes.  Although  sixty-four  percent  of  the  coded  statements 
expressed problems, all these negative arguments were in the form of explanations, and justifications for non-use. 
Relevant literature provides us with similar findings in other studies (Cottier et al., 2015; Ferrire, Cottier, Lacroix, 
Lain, & Pulido, 2013).  

The teachers statements revealed a balance between the female and male participants use of DT tools in the 
classroom: four female and four male participants stated that they used DT in their classrooms (5 occasionally & 3 
regularly); three female participants and four male participants stated that they used digital tools once or a few 
times  with  their  students.  One  female  participant  revealed  that  she  never  used  any  digital  tools  in  her  classes. 
Concerning DT and gender issues, relevant literature has implied greater investment and knowledge from male 
participants  compared  to  female  participants  (Cros,  1997;  Ferrire  et  al.,  2013).  The  analysis  of  the  teachers

statements  did  not  suggest  differences  between  the  teachers  gender,  age,  years  of  experience  and  their 
representations concerning DT. 

Discussion & Implications 

The results obtained from this study bear similarities with other research studies done in diverse educational 
settings (Ely, 1999; Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, 2010; Ertmer, et al., 2012; Prestridge, 2012). All in all, the teachers 
arguments were mainly linked to both internal (personal) and external (other related) factors.  

Research results concerning non-use of DT indicated that:  

(1)  internal factors such as personal interest in technology and positive representations regarding its use and 
perceived self-efficacy in technical skills and pedagogical competencies (see Ely, 1999; Ertmer & Ottenbreit-
Leftwich, 2010; Ertmer, et al., 2012; Prestridge, 2012); and  

(2)  external factors such as support from administrators, suitability of the teacher training programmes offered, 
availability of technical assistance and regular maintenance played key roles in shaping the teachers DT 
practices. Prestridges study also highlights the influence of external factors on teachers representations and 
practices (Prestridge, 2012).  

The  results  obtained  from  this  study  suggest  that  prior  to  the  design  of  any  DT  training  programme  the 

following should be carefully considered: 

(1)  The teachers representations about their skills and their needs and their attitudes toward the DT practices. 

(2)  Availability  of  technical  assistance  and  updated  digital  tools  corresponding  to  the  teachers  pedagogical 

needs. 

(3)  Concordance with the available digital tools and the content of the training programme provided.

The traditional account of knowledge was challenged by 
Gettier (1963) with counterexamples to illustrate that JTB 
is an insufficient understanding of knowledge. One 
counterexample (Gettier 1963, p. 122) provides a scenario 
where Smith and Jones have applied for a job. Smith has 
strong evidence that Jones will get the job (evidence such 
as the President of the company confirmed this) and that 
Jones has 10 coins in their pocket (evidence such as having 
counted Jones coins ten minutes ago). Hence, Smith 
concludes, and is justified in believing that the person to 
receive the job has ten coins in their pocket. Gettier (1963) 
suggests however that Smith will get the job and that they 
also have ten coins in their pocket. So Smiths justified 
belief that the person to receive the job has ten coins in 
their pocket is in fact true, however they cannot claim to 
know this is true because they do not know that they have 
10 coins in their pocket and they falsely believe that Jones 
will get the job. In other words, Gettier (1963) argues, JTB 
is insufficient for a claim of knowledge. 

Nozick (1981) responds to the Gettier problem by 
providing alternative necessary and sufficient conditions 
for knowledge, referred to as the tracking account. He 
claims that S knows that p IFF:

P1) p is true

P2) S believes that p

P3) If p were not true, S would not believe p

Nozick's account asserts that a definition of knowledge 
requires counterfactual conditions rather than justification, 
that is, the inclusion of premises 3 and 4 as a means of 
testing or tracking the truth of a proposition. He contends 
that P3 provides sensitivity to the falsity of a claim, as, if a 
claim were not true, then you would not believe it was 
true. Similarly, P4 as the adherence conditional says that if 
a claim was true, then you would believe it. Together these 
premises seek to track the truth or falsity of a claim to 
show that Ss belief (P2) would alter given the truth of p

by Nozick with respect to incorporating a reliable method

EPILOGUE

Being critical is good, but better with philosophy! From digital transformation
and values to the future of IS research

1. From wishful thinking to motivation:
growing philosophical awareness

Being critical
is a self-directed and self-correcting
capacity to think otherwise about an issue in order
to see the limitations of ones or others past or
present theoretical or practical reasoning about this
issue. In essence, it is about reexivity. In pleading for
being more critical in this editorial that appears as an
epilogue for this Special Issue, I acknowledge my
French inuence and education with an inclination
towards critique and philosophy. The voice of this
epilogue oscillates between the rst person,
thus
reecting a personal opinion and a European and
North American history and a collective voice when
reecting common ground as IT users or as members
of the IS community. Since the editorial where I
expressed my wish for the IS discipline to be more
critical (Rowe, 2010), a number of such papers have
been published in EJIS (eg, Ravishankar, Pan, &
Myers, 2013), notably in the alternative genres
Special Issue and now in this Philosophy Special
Issue. However, I have come to realise the need to
motivate more forcefully this wish for a greater pro-
portion of papers engaged in critique in the above
sense and to show that they require philosophising.

To justify this need for philosophising, I examine
four main reasons to be critical in IS research. First,
the unusual challenges of the digital transformation of
society and related risks invite us to look beyond our
comfort zone, if we want to be able to contribute to
nding solutions and to question values and value
judgments (axiology). Second,
if we take a value
stance, this has implications for methodology (episte-
mology) and the ontology of the world being consid-
ered (metaphysics). Third, philosophising helps us
break out of limitations that unduly restrict our theo-
retical
reasoning
through metatheories and intuition (theoretical ration-
ality). Fourth, we should develop critical
thinking,
covering both theoretical and practical reasoning to
pursue our mission in ways that help students be up
to the demands of their future jobs and meet industry
expectations (practical rationality). The outline of this
editorial will address these reasons in turn. However,
while these reasons motivate engaging in philosophy,
IS researchers may wonder how to begin philosophis-
ing. Ill put forward some tips/ideas as an amateur in

imagination and our

theoretical

 Operational Research Society.

the last section before concluding this editorial whose
to
sole ambition is to question and inspire, not
demonstrate.

If these reasons and ways to be critical are relevant,
philosophy desperately needs to be brought back into
our IS education and thinking. Hence this Special
Issue of EJIS. I highly recommend reading the intro-
duction by the guest editors, Nik Hassan,
John
Mingers and Bernd Stahl before continuing to read
this editorial which is conceived more as furthering a
conversation based on their points than as a scholarly
contribution. As you will see, I am asking questions
more than providing answers, while their editorial
does provide some answers. They not only did a
great job of marshalling and editing these papers,
and developing many others which we hope will
continue their development and be published in
EJIS or other journals, but their paper also provides
an introduction to what philosophy is and to which
domains it covers that are particularly relevant to IS
(ie, metaphysics, epistemology, rationality, and axiol-
ogy). Bringing philosophy back to IS is an important
condition if we want to be equipped for developing
arguments that increase the likelihood of contribut-
ing to the challenges that society is facing. If we are
capable of doing so without neglecting other compe-
tencies that we have already developed, we will also
considerably increase the likelihood of contributing
to a constructive dialogue with other disciplines and
to be recognised as such. My rst overall goal in this
epilogue is to suggest that we need to embrace all four
broad domains of philosophy and not just focus
mostly on epistemology. Taken together the intro-
duction and the set of papers of this issue indicates
that this is feasible. My second objective is to high-
light some limitations of the positivist worldview
which still drives IS research. It prevents us from
dealing with the situations we encounter in our
world of digital transformation. I am not trying to
settle this argument but am simply arguing for a
change towards a philosophy-based embedded dis-
course if we want IS scholarship to be relevant and
critical. This is one of our two pronged strategies for
pushing IS research to the edges (Grover & Lyytinen,
2015; Rowe, 2011). I am just trying here to spell out
the rationale for

2. Unprecedented challenges to societal
values related to digital transformation:
liberty, equality, fraternity

We need to be critical because, in our age of digital
transformation, society faces considerable challenges
and risks related to its core values. R&D spending on
computing and telecommunications has fuelled techno-
logical changes in society and related problems at
unprecedented speed and scale, while research in social
sciences and humanities to study the uses of technology
with the complexity of its eects and implications for
society has not received reasonable support, eort and
funding (Robbin, 2011). IS researchers know that these
eects are not caused by information technologies alone
but are partly shaped by socio-economic relations
(Allmer, Sevignani, & Prodnik, 2015). However,
it
remains dicult not to believe that the systems which
we use daily are implicated in the changes and chal-
lenges of our current world. This is a world that runs at
internet speed, where individuals are becoming heavily
dependent on technologies, if not addicted to some of
them, to the point that the most powerful democracies
can be manipulated by foreign powers (see Hassan,
Mingers, & Stahl, 2018). We give away our self-
awareness to machines like Alexia and our smart houses
erode our self-awareness. Moreover, while IS research-
ers are aware that technology can have unintended
consequences, we tend to see technology as a solution,
not the cause of problems. We can ask the question:
What can IS research do to respond to such issues for
the betterment of the world we live in and its future
(Chiasson, Davidson, & Winter, 2018)? But we must
also see that this requires the development of dialectical
reasoning and reexivity (Cecez-Cekmanovic, 2010),
lest we fall into the trap of Science without conscious-
ness is the ruin of the soul (Rabelais, 1964, p. 137).

The dilemma(s) we face are about the values that
we choose. Todays obvious lesson is that tech giants
not only watch us, but they then apply what we preach
in IS, ie, develop agile apps and digital platforms in
ways that sense and respond to our needs and create
business value (Sambamurthy, Bharadwaj, & Grover,
2003). Further, they learn more about us the more we
use their platforms in order to accumulate the highest
possible value. If we are becoming pawns fascinated by
technologies that are slowly enslaving us for the ben-
ets of a few, it might be too late for a new Jaccuse of
digital capitalism (Grimshaw, 2018) and of a surveil-
lance society (Zubo, 2015). Whatever the truth of
these statements, digital transformation is questioning
our values. Whatever our political preferences, our
responsibility as academics is to reect more about
the personal, collective, and societal risks associated
with digital transformation, and to call into question
the prevailing utilitarian or libertarian thinking to
invite new ways to exert

responsibilities when innovating (Stahl, 2012). Norms
and values are important (Mingers, 1980), and whereas
risks appear at all levels, the greatest diculties lie at
the collective and, in particular, at the societal level
where individuals cannot do much by themselves.

Liberty in the motto of the French Republic and the
rst Amendment of the Bill of Rights to the US
Constitution which protects free speech are exemplars
of how freedom is important to us, to society. But
these values are being questioned, perhaps even mod-
ied by our individual and collective relationship to
technology. On the one hand, freedom of expression
seems to be reinforced by microblogging, voting plat-
forms and online forums as well as email campaigns
which put local to global in a heartbeat (Shirky,
2008, p. 12); and where avatars enable us to express
certain thoughts and facets of our hidden personality
and of the life that we live in cyberspace (Schultze,
2014). Is this a sign of empowerment and emancipa-
tion (Benkler, 2006), or participatory exploitation, as
Marxist analysts would argue (Allmer et al., 2015), in
which behaviours and systems are strategically induced
by the Tech Giants and other powers to exploit indi-
viduals for nancial benet? On the other hand,
whereas the risks of being manipulated by fake news
are as old as philosophy (Goldstein, 2018), new risks
appear such as cyberstalking (Tow, Dell, & Venable,
2010) and phishing (Moody, Galetta, & Dunn, 2017).
What is certainly new is the scale and speed at which
these risks manifest themselves. Globalisation adds a
systemic element to these multiple and data-related
risks (Zubo, 2015). Even if these risks are major, we
can learn to protect ourselves and to manage them.
More importantly however, some threats are internal
to ourselves, in the sense that if we collectively do not
cultivate critical thinking and see the dangers ahead,
it wont be easy to protect ourselves. Whereas tools
can help us full our need for individuation, we
may become gradually and insidiously enslaved by
e-reputation systems or handheld personal tools that
atter our will to power (Nietzche, 1910). For any new
technology weve long known that we can observe
risks and benets and can become pessimistic or opti-
mistic because they exhibit good and dark sides
depending on use and context. We have learned that
many eects are emergent, in the sense that they are
not foreseeable, which runs against the promise of a
computer controlled society (Beniger, 1986), in the
sense that our actions are under control because they
can be programmed/planned, traced and checked by
computers. However, governments have not heard or
most probably do not want to hear this lesson. The
the no touch (contactless) society in
project of
Denmark shows that technological fascination and
vested interests are still dominant and that the project
of a control society is still alive, despite evidence such
total control and

privacy
(Ngwenyama,
Henriksen, & Hardt, under review). If the unforesee-
able eects of technology limit the control that is
possible, then why do we need to worry? The short
answer is: (a) because by denition control unduly
limits our freedom and may exclude people and (b)
is not exercised transparently. But
because control
what if these unforeseeable eects are in fact related
to monitoring exerted by the very few who manipulate
the action dynamics (Zubo, 2015)? Even absent of
any instrumental action, what about exclusion eects 
of the elderly or the handicapped for example  of a
contactless society? Behind the trend of personalisation
of tools and systems (Baskerville, 2011) and the myriad
control and articial intelligence tools that we have
created,
freedom and
autonomy.

there is a debate about

Freedom to express ones views, to be informed, to
communicate, to possess, to travel is, in a word, freedom
to act. For philosophers of action, to act is to do some-
thing voluntarily (Juarrero, 2002). The IS literature has
long considered mandatory vs voluntary use of systems
(Brown, Massey, Montoya-Weiss, & Burkman, 2002)
without going far enough in terms of what this means,
except in rare exceptions such as those considering dis-
ciplined empowerment (Elmes, Strong, & Volko, 2005).
When things become programmed, willingness to
choose can become delegated to the machine or to agents
who may then act based on decision rules provided by
the machine without knowing how the decision was
made. Hence the debate on close vs open code (Lessig,
1999) also referred to as transparency of algorithms
(Kononenko, 2001). What will happen with the myriad
complex services that will be oered with the Internet of
Things (Oberlnder, Rglinger, Rosemann, & Kees,
2017)? Nietzche and Hegel have very profoundly
reected on the dangers of delegating tasks between
humans (Kain, 1996) that we can apply to our relation-
ships with machines. The slave through his work makes
his master dependent on him; and those who think they
are the master may, in reality, become the slave. Not only
are we naked without our IT prostheses, but we do not
control what they do in certain situations. Some would
say, Fine, we have to live with our age. But what if,
without knowledge or control and consent, machines
destroy others lives, others economies, or degrade our
natural environments? How do we conceptualise our
autonomy with respect to autonomous vehicles and
automated trading systems which, by denition, learn
and take decisions, which in turn can, if learning is
signicant, put us in unprecedented or unanticipated
dangerous social situations without our consent? Our
freedom is and has to be limited for moral reasons,
because our freedom should not be exerted at the
expense of others freedom. Hence Kants conceptualisa-
tion of autonomy as self-imposition of the moral law
(Kant, 1785/2011): A rational will must be regarded as

autonomous, or free, in the sense of being the author
of the law that binds it. The fundamental principle of
morality  the Categorical imperative  is none other
than the law of an autonomous will (Johnston, 2016).
This law contains two components: the independence of
ones deliberation and choice from manipulation by
others and the capacity to rule oneself (Dworkin, 1988).
Autonomy can be used to refer both to the global con-
dition (autonomous personhood) and to a more local
notion (Christman, 2015) such as autonomy when
equipped with a smartphone. How and to what extent
can we exert our autonomy? Are free will and constraints
on human behaviour arising from neuronal forces com-
patible (Ellis, Murphy, & OConnor, 2009; Mckenna &
Coates, 2015)?

If our freedom and actions become limited by
systems, so that we consider agency leaning towards
the technology side, technology acquires autonomy
(Markus & Rowe, in press). Does it mean human
autonomy is diminished? IT also enables new actions.
Humans may still have agency in systems which allow
agency to both humans and bots for separate tasks.
Usually we discuss autonomy as an issue for human
subjects. Now, what does it mean for technology to be
free? How can technology identify a moral law, if any;
or put dierently, can computers act as moral agents
(Stahl, 2004)? And if we reject technologys autonomy
how do we ascribe responsibility to humans or orga-
nisations and conceptualise governance in such an
automated world (Leclercq-Vandelannoitte & Bertin,
2018)? Regardless of the position we take on causality
and what legal dispositions prevail, these questions
depend on principles regarding what is action, inten-
tion, will, responsibility, autonomy  all concepts that
have been best delineated and discussed by moral
philosophy (or ethics), particularly since Kant and
by the philosophy of action (Juarrero, 2002), and
not much considered as yet by IS research except in
very specialised journals.

Thus, if digitalisation of society is questioning our
values such as freedom, we see that reasoning criti-
cally about these questions is inuenced by philoso-
phy. On issues like security (control) and privacy,
Lowry, Dinev, and Willison (2017) consider the
ethics of artefacts as a fundamental element for IS
research, albeit not always taken into account. In fact
I would claim that philosophy always inuence IS
work but the way in which it does this is seldom
for practical reasons
made explicit. I know that
related to length of papers and time constraints, we
neglect this. But by doing so we espouse a tradition,
which has implicit or explicit assumptions that we are
often not even aware of. We cannot escape philoso-
phising, even if most of the time, we as IS researchers,
do not build explicitly on philosophy. When we
dont, this blinds us, and it would be better to make
explicit on what (strand of) philosophy we are basing

study, approach,

a particular
ISD method, etc.
(Hirschheim, Klein, & Lyytinen, 1995)? But let me
nish my story about how digitalisation of society is
questioning our values and why better critical reason-
ing invites philosophising.

for

What did equality mean for the rst article of the
Declaration of the Rights of the Man and the Citizen
the rst article of
in 1789,
the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 by the United
Nations, or for Kant in his Groundwork of the meta-
physics of morals? Whatever their dierences in terms
of natural talent, men share equal dignity. Social
distinctions can only be founded on common utility,
states the rst article of the Declaration. This also
meant, after the talents parable in Matthew 25
(1430) (Harrington, 1991), that the natural aristo-
cratic order was over. Dignity was to be gained by
work, by labour (Ferry, 2014) through autonomy and
creativity. Autonomy is needed, because we face
necessity (and again we cannot completely delegate
our share unless we enslave ourselves). Creativity is
needed, because through work, we participate in the
creation of the world that we inhabit. A caveat, how-
ever: creativity works for both good and evil as the
myth of Prometheus tells us. Work is normal because
our human condition is to work, even if it is hard and
resembles labour (St Paul): all men must gain their
dignity. In the Benedictine monasteries ora et labora
is the rule because to work is to avoid all sorts of
vices, especially laziness and hubris. In a society
where bots execute more and more tasks, how do
people, highly qualied or not, access work or keep
their job and therefore exert their equality in dignity?
For Marxist analysts, digital labour can be seen as
reproducing power structures and unequally distrib-
uted life chances (Allmer et al., 2015; Bergvall-
Kreborn & Howcroft, 2014), if not by reinforcing
them to the benet of the platform owners (Fuchs &
Sevignani, 2013). They distinguish, digital
labour
toil  a form oered by the logic of capitalism 
from playful digital work in line with the logic of
the commons (Fuchs & Sevignani, 2013). For philo-
sophers like Kant or Serres, technology is neutral. We
cannot just say that technology eliminates work; it is
society and institutions that shape such choices
(Kreps, 2018) and can make them good or evil, and
human beings more or less equals in dignity.

Many modern nations and regimes have advocated
praising liberty and equality while privileging one a
little more over the other, thus leading towards more
libertarian or more egalitarian societies (Stone, 2001).
Socialist regimes advocate the removal of inequalities
among people, mostly material ones because they

too-
individualistic society, if we forget Kants categorical
imperative, present in the Declaration of human and
citizen rights, individual liberty could cause harm to
others. While the ideas of liberty and equality were
part of the Enlightenment, another political philoso-
phy seems to have made its way over the last two
centuries: utilitarianism, which states that the proper
course of action is the one that maximises utility and
benets the majority. Utilitarianism, also called con-
sequentialism (Mingers & Walsham, 2010), can be
considered ethically weak because it is insensitive to
rights. However, as advocated by Bentham and Mills
in the nineteenth century, utilitarianism can be con-
sidered a fundamental instrument for justifying deci-
sions of a technological society, a society that believes
in technical progress. Such an approach, based as it is
on methodological individualism, can become dan-
gerous if the majority is blind to its potential dangers
or is manipulated by a few. To counter such perils,
including those of collective regimes that could go
too far on equality and those of liberal regimes that
could go too far on liberty, revolutionaries added a
third value to bind the rst two together: fraternity,
which includes both Philadelphia (brotherly love) and
Adelphotes (community of brothers).

For Arendt, human fallibility in the execution of a
contract is the price of freedom. The impossibility of
perfect control within a community of equals is the
consequence of plurality and reality. . . the joy of
inhabiting together a world whose reality is guaran-
teed for each by the presence of all [. . .] In contrast
Varians vision of a computer-mediated world strikes
me as an arid wasteland  not a community of equals
bound through law in the inevitable and ultimately
fruitful human struggle with uncertainty. (Zubo,
2015, p. 81)

Is digitalisation moving individuals and society towards
wider social identity? and fraternity? Let us consider
two brief examples: social media and interaction with
robots, whether mediated by experts or not. Some may
consider that any platform that allows people to com-
municate together is an important path towards recog-
nising each other and fraternity. On the other hand,
when we experience negative behaviours on social
media, we may view these platforms as being used
more in the pursuit of private interests and to monetise
our personal data, which runs counter to augmenting
trust and possible fraternity. A deeper philosophical
explanation interprets social media behaviours as either
instrumental communication at play, as described by
Habermas or Gomann, or as a Bourdieusian pursuit of
social, and possibly economic, capital (Qi, Monod,
Fang, & Deng, 2018). Alternatively, one can question
whether attitudes and behaviours on such platforms

384

EPILOGUE

reect a need to search for oneself, to which Sartres
philosophy is appropriate or Heideggers notions of
shared-world and being with others (Qi et al., 2018).
Levinass philosophy could also be explored as explain-
ing the diculties rather than the desire for social media
(Introna & Brigham, 2007). Going beyond the usual
psychological approaches to explain and discuss tech-
nological choices, philosophy can thus help interpret
the good and dark sides of behaviours at the societal
level, such as how and why we associate IT artefact with
certain values (eg, social media with fraternity) and
hence enable us to re-conceptualise the IT artefact
(Cheikh-Ammar, 2018).

Similarly, interactions with robots can aect our
feelings of fraternity. Robots can replace humans for
dicult or dangerous tasks, or cooperate with humans;
this is the promise of the interesting concept of cobo-
tics. Bots can be also useful as agents when humans
cannot be present. However, fraternity is not enhanced
when people interact with machines. And we experi-
ence social isolation when relating with machines takes
up most of our time (Kreps, 2018). On the contrary, our
humanity and fraternity are enhanced when we have in-
depth relationships with other humans, when we spend
time with them, when we show signs of caring and
compassion. Social recognition is a precondition for
human relationships and fraternity. Social recognition
cannot be imparted to robots or voice servers, despite
the extensive progress made by articial intelligence for
personal identication. Hence, the human preference
for face-to-face interactions, even when there are no
cognition problems with user-friendly machines
(Rowe & Limayem, 1999). This is why organisations
using articial intelligence have understood that it is
preferable that messages continue to be presented by
employees to customers. The selection process, the
denition of targets that can be attracted by mass cus-
tomisation oerings,
is assigned to bots, but it is
humans who make contact so that customers perceive
the targeting process as not so mechanistic.

Returning once again to the notion of fraternity:
machines currently have no capacity to compute
meaning, because meaning is not strictly the applica-
tion of rules to transform some symbols into other
symbols (Searle, 1980). It is about understanding
what one is doing (Obermeier, 1983). There is no
human-machine communication of meanings in a
conversation of humans with machines. The general
problem of supplying thoughts to Articial Agents,
can only be addressed when, rst,
the Symbol
Grounding Problem is solved, thereby giving con-
cepts
to the manipulated symbols, and second,
when articial consciousness is achieved, thereby giv-
ing intentionality to those manipulated symbols
(Rodriguez, Hermosillo, & Lara, 2012). Articial
intelligence techniques use voice and image recogni-
tion, but they do not identify a person per se. Plato

asked: how do we identify each other as a person, as
humans? And he answered that it was not by sense
impression (Whitaker, 1996), but by recognising our
Being or Oneness with the other (McDowell, 1973).
When articial intelligence diagnoses a dicult case
or situation, to what extent will the human justify a
the human appears only as machine
decision if
appendage? Indeed, we may still assume that the
human will have to do the work, at least in certain
critical situations to which we are particularly sensi-
tive. Even if Watson proves much more reliable and
eective in identifying tumours and cancers than
radiologists, will the radiologists just endorse the
machine diagnosis without independently checking
to conrm it? In other words, while the costs of
reliable predictions based on articial
intelligence
drop, the need for advanced human judgment skills
sensitive bad news
may grow, especially about
(Agrawal, Gans, & Goldfarb, 2018). What we have
learnt about more classical decision support systems
(Rowe, 2006) still holds, except that here we are
talking about human life. In fact, many patients
may well not accept the machines diagnosis without
the assessment and conrmation of
their doctor
(Farajallah, Le Go-Pronost, Penard, & Suire, 2015).
If doctors conrm that their ex post-diagnosis agrees
with Watsons, why and how would they invest in
such aid? And if the two diagnoses are contradictory,
doctors may be put in a very dicult position. Such
situations are complex and show that even though
deep learning has made great advances, there is still a
long way before a machine can completely replace
health professionals and patients or doctors will com-
pletely trust a machine.

So far we have discussed how IT might inuence the
values on which the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was founded in 1948. IT is also supporting evol-
ving values such as control or security as noticed above as
well as collaboration and non-possession with the rise of
the sharing economy (Belk, 1988). Whether the latter is
reinforcing fraternity among humans or indicates a
growing concern for sustainability or simple economic
rationality is an interesting avenue for IS research.
More radical advances in IT and biotechnologies might
have a more disruptive eect on our values. The trans-
humanist dream to extend life by a hundred years by
replacing entire human organs as they age can be inter-
preted as adding eternity to Enlightenment values. It can
also be seen as playing God, like Prometheus who was
punished for his theft of re, but also for having stolen
Athenas powers to create the arts and all sorts of articial
artefacts. As described in the Book of Genesis, this is the
capital sin, the hubris of wanting to play God or to
become Homo Deus (Harari, 2015). Just as importantly,
this would lead to society, as in Greek cosmology, of
eternals (gods) and mortals  indeed, a mortal breach
in the notion of fraternity and equality.

Even if all these technologies, including articial
intelligence, are a long way from the point at which
the above statements could be anywhere close to
some reality, the minimum we owe our students
and children is to say that caution and philosophical
thinking are in order! We wont be credible if we say
we could not know, even if in truth we do not now
know. What is clear is that most of the questions I
have too quickly raised in this section are complex
and far beyond the simple constructs that we use in
our usual IS research papers. We must return to
philosophy to engage with the complexity of the
world we live in to conceptualise issues and what
they can mean for dierent stakeholders.

3. Bringing metaphysics back to engage with
axiology

As argued by the guest editors, serious questions
require serious examination of even harder questions.
While the IS discipline has made major eorts and
contributed in the domain of epistemology and meth-
odology, I would argue that we still need to do much
more on the three other domains of philosophy pre-
sented by the guest editors: metaphysics, rationality,
and axiology. While there has been some work on
ethics, Nik Hassan, John Mingers and Bernd Stahl
underscore that IS research needs to be engaged with
the many risks related to digital transformation. This
takes us into the realm of values. Axiology is a vast
domain, but to treat its issues seriously we need a
strong intellectual basis in metaphysics (Hassan et al.,
2018; Kreps, 2018). And to begin with, who are we
to have values? What is a human being? Philosophy
of Mind is important because it addresses the ques-
tions of consciousness,
language, and reason. For
Aristotle and Descartes body and mind/soul were
distinct. While Kant kept this distinction, for some
revolutionaries of the Enlightenment, Soul is a vain
notion (La Mettrie, 1753). Being a machine, know-
ing how to distinguish good from evil, being born
with intelligence and a reliable instinct of moral, and
being an animal are things that are not more contra-
dictory than being a monkey or a parrot and giving
oneself pleasure (p. 34), Mettrie believed. Man is a
machine. . . a substance (p. 37), he proposed, and
this view is mirrored in some eliminative material-
ist philosophies of the twentieth century such as
especially
those
Churchland, for whom consciousness is mere electro-
eervescent delusion. Such behaviourist and materi-
alist goals of reducing the mental to the physical, of
course, tend to result in absurdity, damaging both
our idea of what the mind is and what the physical
universe constitutes. Such views are countered by a
range of other philosophers and positions, including
for whom our
Nagel, Bergson and Whitehead,

Rorty

Speculative

and how we

subjectivity is undeniably real,
for whom human
awareness and experience are more than a mere
pack of neurons (Libet, 2005, p. 5), and for whom
some more dualist or idealist position must be found.
Discussing such ontological questions is critical for
IS research, but we should also explore other forms of
realism than critical realism, such as embodied rea-
lism and speculative realism, as well as diverse types
of idealism. Embodied realism oers potential for
cognition, the design of human-computer interfaces,
neuro IS and modelling, among other domains where
there is direct application in IS, because it explains
why we use metaphors
reason
causally (Lako & Johnson, 1999; Markus & Rowe,
in press). In fact, embodied realism can be considered
as a revolution regarding many entrenched beliefs in
philosophical systems based on recent discoveries of
cognitive sciences, such as the inherently embodied
mind (against Cartesian and Kantian dualism), the
mostly unconscious mind and reasoning, and the
metaphorical character of abstract concepts. As a
consequence of this embodiment, the mind cannot
be known simply by self-reection. This justies
empirical research, but also has consequences for
morality
realism
(Harman, 2010; Meillassoux, 2010), which builds on
Latour, who himself builds on Whitehead, is promis-
ing for those who question sociomaterial interactions.
Whiteheads process-relational cosmology (ontology)
(Whitehead, 1929) builds on Bergsons notion of time
and is an important intellectual source for at
ontologies, applicable to worlds where processes
involve
and emerging wholes
(Markus & Rowe, in press) not dierent in ontologi-
cal status (De Landa, 2002), and for thinking about
inuential thinkers for IS research like Latour (Kreps,
2018). In his polemic Against Nature, Kreps (2018)
brilliantly demonstrates how strongly IS research has
been and still is inuenced by a positivist view of the
world, which insists on methodological individual-
ism, and which screens out the reality of subjective
consciousness, pretends that the rational agent user
is an apolitical and atheoretical depiction of
the
human condition, rather than a specic tool of neo-
classical economic theory and neoliberal politics
(p. 97), and negates the myriad relationships that
exist in a world that is becoming. Instead, Kreps
to borrow from Bergsons and
(2018) proposes
Whiteheads process-relational philosophy,
from
moral philosophy and from complexity theory, to
claim that the libertarian argument for the neoliberal
digital capitalist society runs counter to the reality of
the natural world of which we are a part.

interacting parts

Journal articles cannot do justice to such rich trans-
disciplinary work, but it is important to note here, that
in the eyes of Bergson and Whitehead, all matter and
subjectivity are interrelated in an ongoing processual

386

EPILOGUE

ow and that interpretivism is closer to reality than
positivism. From an axiological perspective, much
must be held in common (Kreps, 2018, p. 82).
Blondel was born in 1861 like Whitehead and died 2
years after him in 1949. They did not know each other,
but they both constructed a cosmology which strives
to answer the question of how freedom of the indivi-
dual is compatible with the idea that each person is
related through numerous linkages to all other beings
and, even, to the entire universe. Put otherwise, how
can we understand that the greater the density of the
network that relates this real entity to the universe, the
more its individuation is complete? The universe is
one continuous energy soup where dierences are
only distinguishable by density and perspective of the
viewer. We are constantly exchanging energy with
the Sun, the Earth, all the galaxies and black holes in
a time-space continuum. Such views relate science,
metaphysics and theology. In particular, Whiteheads
cosmology has far-reaching consequences which chal-
lenge our notion of a stable relationship between
object and attribute, what in design science research
we also model as ontologies and implement in rela-
tional databases (Giacomoni & Sardas, 2014). Based on
the scientic knowledge of the twentieth century the
embodied realism of Lako and Johnson and the
cosmologies of Blondel and Whitehead oer very dif-
ferent ontologies of the world which challenge ethical
knowledge and responsibilities.

4. Philosophising because theory
development requires metatheories and
intuition

These glimpses of how philosophy can help IS
research face our societal challenges through axiology
and metaphysics also have consequences for episte-
mology and rationality. We certainly need philosophy
because we rst need to ground the knowledge we
produce in epistemology, a branch of philosophy
which discusses the validity conditions of the produc-
tion of scientic knowledge (Lee, 2004).

First, axiology is invited in epistemology when we
use a critical theoretical methodology and take a value
position to challenge the status quo as recommended
by Myers and Klein (2011) as one of the six principles
for conducting critical social research. Critical research
is a quest against injustice and undue limitations of
freedom, which calls for a methodology dierent from
an interpretive methodology that interprets values but
does not challenge the status quo (Cecez-Cekmanovic,
2010; Rowe, 2009). The Critical social sciences [. . .]
require normative theoretical foundations and a dif-
ferent research methodology to deal with moral and
normative-ethical questions to pursue emancipatory
interests (Cecez-Cekmanovic, 2010, p. 4). This is
necessary for both individual emancipation and for

societal
issues
improvement. These methodological
are addressed with very dierent arguments by a neo-
humanist strand, largely based on Habermas, which
focuses on denaturalising restrictive forms of
IS
development and use, and by a post-humanist
strand largely based on Foucault, who questions the
humanist assumption of the unied autonomous sub-
ject (Cecez-Cekmanovic, 2010). To Myers and Kleins
six principles, Cecez-Kecmanovic proposes adding the
overarching principle of reexivity and dialectical
reasoning which falls
type of
rationality.

into a dierent

Second, metaphysics, such as those proposed by
Bergson, Blondel and Whitehead as well as speculative
realism by Harman, Meillassoux and others, invites us
to reconsider positively the role of intellectual think-
ing, metatheories, intuition and theoretical reasoning
in the face of what can be perceived as the imperialism
of methodological reason (Aronowitz & Ausch, 2000).
Such reason is rooted in Kant and modern science,
which have retained the knowing subject/object of
knowledge distance, also known as Cartesian dualism.
This culminated with the Vienna circle of logical
empiricists whose primary claim was
to abolish
metatheory, that is, to deny any proposition that
failed the tests of observation and experiment
(Aronowitz & Ausch, 2000, p. 701).
Indeed, by
requiring that all scientic investigation be subject
to falsication, positivism restricted scientic inquiry
to objects whose propositions and observational state-
ments can be operationalised in methodological terms.
[. . .] Thinking a world beyond-the-given became rele-
gated to non-Anglo-American philosophy. (idem,
p. 702). Retroductive process in Critical realism is an
eort to infer a causal mechanism to explain the given
empirical phenomenon and thus develops a theorising
that goes beyond (Williams & Wynn, 2018). However,
unlike Bhaskar, the way critical realism is mainly
applied in social sciences, management, and IS has a
strong empirical focus, and is not oriented towards a
metatheoretical construction and a new philosophy for
what Langefors (1980) called our infological world. A
philosophical discussion based on critical realism
would be to discuss intransitive structures (Mingers,
2014). Another way to go beyond the given is by
developing justied (!) models of possible future
worlds (Frank, 2006; Rorty, 1999) that serve those
who live the future as an inspiration, and a meaningful
orientation. The respective constructions cannot be
invalidated by confronting them with empirical data,
because they are purposefully dierent from reality.
(Olbrich, Frank, Gregor, Niederman, & Rowe, 2017).
Aronowitz and Ausch follow Feyerabends (1998)
and Kuhns critique of Popper in arguing against posi-
tivist methodologies. They rst consider solutions that
other social scientists have brought to the subject-
object dualism. They present two main approaches of

hermeneutic and phenomenology, both of which have
been adopted in IS research. While introducing a
principle of interaction between researchers and actors
(eg, Klein & Myers, 1999), Aronowitz and Ausch con-
tend that hermeneutic approaches in social sciences
are also dominated by method. This is not the case
with Alford (1998). He puts on par evidence and
theory and shows that there is always a choice in
terms of
theorising between putting emphasis on
explaining what happened, emphasising the meanings
and tracing historically the events, but that all three
aspects should be involved, as demonstrated using
masterpieces of the founding fathers of sociology:
Durkheim, Marx, and Weber. For Alford the task of
the researcher is to choose which one of the three will
be in the foreground while including the other two in
the background. In a given inquiry, these three aspects
of theoretical development are necessary, but not of
equal importance depending on theoretical choice.

that

tradition is

With phenomenology, the critique of positivism is
more radical because it not only rejects dualism, it
advocates a knowing that is inherently individually
subjective. Social objects are always
interpreted,
and these interpretations are always mediated by
metatheories which are generally ignored and
must be revealed. However, Aronowitz and Ausch
the risk posed by
(2000, p. 712) recognise that
theory
the phenomenological
development becomes so important that it loses the
concrete historicity of the object to be studied. In
their essay (Aronowitz & Ausch, 2000) opt, along
with Feyerabend and a rich philosophical tradition,
for a position where social knowledge can be derived
without method. They propose an onto-historical
paradigm based on a dierent understanding of
objectivity: A historically situated and oscillating
Being is the case, not the divided subject/object
(p. 713).
Inspired by Sartre, Spinoza, Deleuze,
Adorno and many others, they claim that engage-
ment with the complex and mostly messy world and
its history and [of] the body with its intuitive tenta-
cles, constitute an adequate basis for knowledge
(p. 717). By a single stroke [science] claimed to
sweep away the tradition of a hundred thousand
years, which had become one with human nature
itself. It wrote an end to the ancient animist covenant
between man and nature, leaving nothing in place of
that precious bond but an anxious quest in a frozen
universe of solitude. [. . .] [Science] has however com-
mended recognition, but

perceive something, to be aware of an object, as
phenomenology argues. While Blondel wants
to
ground his philosophy on science, he criticises the
incapacity of science to seize the unity of Being in
evolution. As claimed by Aristotle, we can also
acquire knowledge by intuition.
Intuition stems
from what we experience and theorise and is beyond
the analytical processes of science (Klein & Rowe,
2008; Schwartz, 2011), such as dierentiation or frac-
talisation (as described by Kuhn (Tarafdar &
Davison, in press)).

Ultimately, this is why, although counter to the
dominant paradigm, theory development and metathe-
ories are needed. To advance research requires adding
value on at least one of the two levels, theoretical
or empirical. I would argue that in IS, because we
are strong in methods and confront phenomena
where empirical richness seems to expand like the uni-
verse, we too often neglect to develop our theoretical
reasoning and conceptual reasoning based on intuition
(Stahl, 2014). Hence, the need for pure theory develop-
ment papers in our preferred set of genres of papers
(Teeni, Rowe, gerfalk, & Lee, 2015)!

5. Critique is in our mission, and society
expects it for deliberating about action

Being critical is part of the mission of all scholars,
and explicitly of those of us who publish in EJIS. This
is not just an issue for research and theoretical rea-
soning, which deals with epistemology and concerns
all scientists, but of practical reasoning that would
benet both our students and society when question-
ing how agents deliberate about action (Wallace,
2014). Reecting about practical reasoning in specic
circumstances of everyday life, at work or in private
life, falls in the domain of the philosophy of action.
Unlike theoretical reason,

Practical reason, by contrast, is concerned not with
the truth of propositions but with the desirability or
value of actions. [. . .] Practical reason takes a dis-
tinctively normative question as its starting point. It
typically asks, of a set of alternatives for action none
of which has yet been performed, what one ought to
do, or what it would be best to do. [. . .] The contrast
between practical and theoretical reason is essentially
a contrast between two dierent systems of norms:
those for the regulation of action on the one hand,
and those for the regulation of belief on the other.
[. . .] Theoretical reasoning leads to modications of
our beliefs, whereas practical reasoning leads to
modications of our
(Bratman 1987;
Harman, 1986). (Wallace, 2014)

intentions

Like Aronowitz and Ausch, we do not claim that we
should stop publishing non-critical papers. This
would be unrealistic, but also foolish, because the
reviewing process brings a critique, and such papers,
when published in good journals can be considered as

388

EPILOGUE

having epistemic validity, even when they do not
inscribe themselves in some critical thinking. My
frustration with non-critical research is related to
the often limited contributions these approaches
oer in practice, both in terms of theorising (as
demonstrated in the case of positivist research by
Grover and Lyytinen (2015) and in terms of their
practical implications. Hence, my desire for EJIS to
publish a greater proportion of critical papers.
However, I want to emphasise that I do not consider
that non-critical papers cannot make important con-
tributions if they introduce or relax specic con-
straints in their underlying assumptions. In other
words, one can be positivist and critically useful, or
interpretivist and critically useful without espousing
or developing a critical social theory. To begin with
the last combination, any good interpretivist study is
a potential foundation for a critical one taking a value
stance. How can one be both critical and positivist?
For instance, an in-depth utilitarian approach would
be critical and distinguished from mere consequenti-
alism, if it considers the risks and benets for each
type of heterogeneous stakeholders rather than con-
sidering only the eectiveness of proposed solutions
for the majority. This would also suppose that the
hidden costs and risks be revealed to the stakeholders.
In many cases if users knew about the current impli-
cations of their use they might prefer discontinue
using the service and their expressed utility would
change. This would contribute to emancipating we
humans from false consciousness, collective delu-
sions and oppressive ideologies that we have created
(Habermas, 1984). Current revelations on digitalisa-
tion of society suggest that we have a false conscious-
ness, collective delusion, or at least an uncritical
ideological embrace of it (Rosen, 1996).

We also need to develop the critical practical rea-
soning of our students, which will also benet our
stakeholders. With greater professionalisation of
Bachelors and Masters programmes, higher education
has emphasised IS/IT operational knowledge for
higher employability. In a eld where knowledge and
know-how are constantly renewed, this professionali-
sation trend has reached its main goal: students being
quickly recruited. But this has sometimes come at the
expense of critical thinking development which may
be lacking. And that is precisely what recruiters con-
sider
students are missing the most
(Kappelman, Johnson, Torres, Maurer, & Mclean,
under review). There are certainly many ways to
develop critical thinking, but remaining open to dif-
ferent paths oers the best safeguard against research
programmes dead-ends. Learning from our own errors
as well as from others in organisations and society can
be very protable and is at the basis of the teaching
case study method. Accompanied with a base of cri-
tical thinking related to current and past societal

that our

problems, forms of critical practical reasoning can be
developed for decision-making related to investments
and IS development and use (Hirschheim et al., 1995;
Ngwenyama & Klein, in press).

6. How to engage with philosophy (when one
has not been trained in philosophy)?

If youre going to reopen basic philosophical issues,
heres the minimum you have to do. First, you need
a method of investigation. Second, you have to use
that method to understand basic philosophical con-
cepts. Third, you have to apply that method to pre-
vious philosophies to understand what
they are
about and what makes them hang together. And
fourth, you have to use that method to ask the big
questions: What it is to be a person? What is mor-
ality? How do we understand the causal structure of
the universe?. (Lako & Johnson, 1999, p. 8)

Consistently with my caution about the best method
(dont get me wrong, I am not against method; other-
wise, I would not be an academic; but Im against its
supremacy or dogmatic use!) I am not arguing for a
given methodology for philosophising. Philosophising
requires reexivity and freedom. Leibniz recognised
that we should distinguish between the issue of
method of inquiry (how to discover) and method of
exposition or writing (how to expose what we have
learned) which can be typical of a philosophical genre
(Loekmer, 1966). Rather,
I prefer a diversity of
approaches for both and would avoid any strong nor-
mative recommendation of what should be done.
Moreover, because of limited space, let me oer just
a few thoughts.

What can I know and how to investigate it? To
engage with philosophy is to be open and is a matter
of state of mind. The method of enquiry depends on
ones research goal. If you are ready for a long jour-
ney identify the best philosophical system and adjust
it for IS research! Some may prefer to begin studying
a philosophical system which, in the idealist tradition,
generalises a great idea (eg, Kants transcendental
idealism which allows to distinguish dierent episte-
mic trends in IS (Monod, 2003)) or oer an approach
that can be systematically applied to information
system (eg, Pierces triadic sign (Beynon-Davies,
2018), whereas others with a more practical inclina-
tion will look at how philosophy can inform their
problem at hand. They would,  la Aristotle, distin-
guish and relate their problem and issues with what
dierent philosophers may have said about them. It
is with this practical inclination that Lynne Markus
and I worked on our study of causality. Without
espousing any philosophical system, what we took
from analytical philosophy was an ability to interro-
gate our language, whose most radical position is
exemplied by the late Wittgenstein, who considered
that philosophy had nothing else to say, but could

help interrogate our language and logic, ie, our rea-
soning. Philosophy strives to generalise and by this
eort explore the powerfulness of a coherent system
of thought. Whether it is applied to all entities (as in
metaphysics) or only to the issue of language and
scientic language in particular (analytic philosophy)
is what divides continental philosophy from analyti-
cal philosophy.

How can one expose the ndings of ones philoso-
phical investigations? When we in the western world
assert that the Greeks invented philosophy, we in fact
recognise that they developed a method for exposing
and at the same time probing their knowledge. As
mentioned by the guest editors of this Special Issue,
philosophy and science were the same thing, but we
can argue that other civilisation (eg, Egyptian) has
already developed scientic knowledge. What
the
Greek invented was the critical discourse which devel-
ops through dialogue and argumentation (Howland,
argumentation
1992; Nightingale, 2000). Critical
through
self-
exploration about what we know and do has been an
essential part of philosophy throughout Renaissance
(eg, De Montaigne, 1580/2003). Engaging in dialogue
about problems claries discourse, avoids dead-ends
and opens up new perspectives. It is the traditional
method and the Greek heritage for exposing ones
ideas in philosophy which was still used throughout
enlightenment (eg, Diderot, 1785/1999) until today
(Deleuze & Parnet, 1987). This why alternatives genres
(Avital, Mathiassen, & Schultze, 2017), such as polemic
(Walsham, 2010) and theatre (Boland & Lyytinen,
2017) can play an important role for IS research.

open-mindedness,

erudition,

and

Alternatively following Descartes, several philoso-
phical systems have been exposed after the axiomatic
or deductive method. They look for the primary idea,
the idea from which all others derive. The archetypal
exemplar is Spinozas Ethics (not to be confused with a
discourse on morality) in which he uses this Cartesian
method with axioms, theorems, and corollaries to
deduct the essence of all things. This approach was
followed by Fichte, Hegel and Schelling. Malebranche
or Leibniz Theodicies also oer good instantiations of
this analytical method. Game theory can be viewed as a
this method for collective
modern descendent of
choices related to utilitarianism (Burgess, 2005). It has
been applied for modelling specic information system
problems (eg, Galbreth & Shor, 2010). However, cali-
bration and ndings should be discussed in light of
underlying philosophical assumptions of the model
and claims of superiority (such as rule utilitarianism
over act utilitarianism (eg, Burgess, 2005) toned down.
Whether for inquiry or exposition, the method of
philosophising is critical discourse in which members of
the community discuss particulars of challenging exis-
tential issues and hammer out reasoned positions about
them that cannot necessarily be codied in episteme (cf.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

389

Aristotle, 1934; Habermas, 1973; Toulmin, 2009). In
spirit true philosophising never claims to arrive at a
denitive answer (eg, on how to combine causality
positions on various dimensions (Markus & Rowe, in
press), as philosophers of science, notably Kuhn and
Popper, have convincingly argued. This holds even
more true for phenomena we study in IS which involves
studying social phenomena or designing tools for social
actors and belongs to social sciences. While in IS
research there is room for replication and negation
studies following a neo-positivist epistemology, one
could regard replication more broadly in a dierent
epistemological perspective as an integral part of an
ongoing critical discourse. In that sense, replication
would mean starting a discourse on a previous study,
story, scenario, artefact, method etc. and then trying to
validate it by reconstructing its epistemological out-
come (Olbrich et al., 2017). In a way this is the assump-
tion on which Design Science Research is based  the
idea that a designed artefact will replicate its eects
under certain conditions. However, this solution repli-
cation is always questionable in absence of a solid
theoretical framework. This critical argument  in the
narrow sense of epistemic critique  partakes in the
current debate on Design Science Research and its
genres (Peers, Tuunanen, & Niehaves, 2018). It should
nevertheless be furthered beyond a quarrel about the
best methodology and be discussed at the ethical and
metaphysical levels as well to reect a broader critical
discourse (eg, Klein, 1981; Mingers & Walsham, 2010;
Ulrich, 2003), ie, what philosophising is about.

Header: 7. Conclusion
Philosophy is the mother of all disciplines (cf. Hassan
et al., 2018). Today it can help IS research nurture itself
and face its most critical challenges related to digital
transformation and beyond. It is intimately tied to our
critical thinking because it proposes dierent thinking
systems, dierent paradigms or worldviews and not just
the three or four usual suspects, such as post-positivism,
critical realism, radical (also called pragmatic) construc-
tivism, interpretivism, we generally encounter in epis-
temology discourses (eg, Avenier & Thomas, 2015).
Any issue or solution can be examined from an onto-
logical (metaphysical), axiological or epistemological
viewpoint,
if not simply from a logical viewpoint,
because we encounter issues with language when we
engage in such knowledge work. Philosophy also pro-
vides a kind of grounding of ideas with insightful syn-
thetic arguments around which several disciplines can
build and confront their own perspectives when they
address complex issues. It enables us to go beyond
specialised traditions for attending to these systemic
Jean-Louis Le Moignes philosopy;
challenges (eg,
Eriksson, 1997). The relative lack of truly interdisciplin-
ary papers in our general IS journals  our so called AIS

390

EPILOGUE

basket of 8  might be partly related to the eorts such
projects require, but also to the fact that philosophy is
rarely invited in such interdisciplinary eorts (Tarafdar
& Davison, in press). IS researchers should view engage-
ment with philosophy as an opportunity. As compared
to other disciplines studying digitalisation, we actually
know a bit and care about technology. This suggests two
things, that (a) we can develop a deeper understanding
and (b) we can actually change the current state of
aairs by designing new IT and digital practices if we
recognise the limitations of our research, risks of what
we propose, and are explicit about our philosophical
assumptions.

Unfortunately, philosophy is a discipline in which
many IS and non-IS researchers are no longer educated
(Stocker, 2018). Management disciplines have elimi-
nated this source, except perhaps philosophy of science.
Returning to this source and reclaiming it would help
us face todays challenges and if we truly interrogate the
limitations of our knowledge. Philosophy is key to
developing the capacity to be critical  a soft skill, the
lack of which worries the recruiters of our students 
because it entails reexivity and helps us to remain
open in the conversation (Gadamer, 1975; Toulmin,
2009). If stakeholders or researchers also look for
emancipation in organisations or society, philosophy
of action and moral philosophy may seem inevitable.
I do not take such a dogmatic stance as I have shown
above while expressing a desire for more critical theory
papers. Any paper built upon a thorough critique,
following the denition proposed at the outset of this
paper, which bears fruit is philosophising and welcome.
We have moved into abstraction (Ciborra, 1998;
Feyerabend, 1999), but we are missing many opportu-
nities to interrogate the richness of the problem space
that digital transformation has created for us. Schutz
and Luckmann (1973) argue for the expansion of
inquiry into aspects of our everyday life (as the pre-
eminent reality) such as the meaning-strata that turns
our material objects (our artefacts) into cultural objects
and infuses our ideas and set the limits of our recipro-
cal action as well as our self-understanding. Many
questions have not been treated because of our neglect
of philosophy. In the last century Heidegger warned in
the Question Concerning Technology (1954):

Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to tech-
nology, whether we passionately arm or deny it.
But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible
way when we regard it as something neutral. [. . .]
Everything depends on our manipulating technology
in the proper manner as a means. We will, as we say,
get technology spiritually in hand. We will master
it. The will to mastery becomes all the more urgent
the more technology threatens to slip from human
control. (Heidegger, 1954, pp. 45)

In order for the IS eld to escape the blinkers that might
be placed on it and in order to produce knowledge that

socially relevant and inuential, our
is original,
researchers need to conceive and explore alternatives
to current ways of thinking. Philosophy oers guidance
along that path (Hassan, 2014). All the reasons for being
critical, whether we like them or not, point to the
necessity of philosophy.

This special issue is not the rst important collective
eort on philosophy by IS researchers which goes
beyond epistemology (eg. Mingers & Willcocks, 2004;
Hirschheim et al. 2011), but I hope that this issue will
help show how interesting and enriching philosophis-
ing can be for IS research. I want to express our most
heartfelt thanks to Bernd, John and Nik, and to all the
authors and reviewers who made this special issue
possible. They demonstrate that philosophising in IS
research is doable, enjoyable, rewarding and that it has
made considerable progress with the support of its
the Association of
Special
Information Systems and as a regular track at ICIS! I
invite the reader to enjoy their introduction to philo-
sophy and its origins, as well as their mapping of
philosophy in four dimensions. Chapeau!

EPILOGUE

Being critical is good, but better with philosophy! From digital transformation
and values to the future of IS research

1. From wishful thinking to motivation:
growing philosophical awareness

Being critical
is a self-directed and self-correcting
capacity to think otherwise about an issue in order
to see the limitations of ones or others past or
present theoretical or practical reasoning about this
issue. In essence, it is about reexivity. In pleading for
being more critical in this editorial that appears as an
epilogue for this Special Issue, I acknowledge my
French inuence and education with an inclination
towards critique and philosophy. The voice of this
epilogue oscillates between the rst person,
thus
reecting a personal opinion and a European and
North American history and a collective voice when
reecting common ground as IT users or as members
of the IS community. Since the editorial where I
expressed my wish for the IS discipline to be more
critical (Rowe, 2010), a number of such papers have
been published in EJIS (eg, Ravishankar, Pan, &
Myers, 2013), notably in the alternative genres
Special Issue and now in this Philosophy Special
Issue. However, I have come to realise the need to
motivate more forcefully this wish for a greater pro-
portion of papers engaged in critique in the above
sense and to show that they require philosophising.

To justify this need for philosophising, I examine
four main reasons to be critical in IS research. First,
the unusual challenges of the digital transformation of
society and related risks invite us to look beyond our
comfort zone, if we want to be able to contribute to
nding solutions and to question values and value
judgments (axiology). Second,
if we take a value
stance, this has implications for methodology (episte-
mology) and the ontology of the world being consid-
ered (metaphysics). Third, philosophising helps us
break out of limitations that unduly restrict our theo-
retical
reasoning
through metatheories and intuition (theoretical ration-
ality). Fourth, we should develop critical
thinking,
covering both theoretical and practical reasoning to
pursue our mission in ways that help students be up
to the demands of their future jobs and meet industry
expectations (practical rationality). The outline of this
editorial will address these reasons in turn. However,
while these reasons motivate engaging in philosophy,
IS researchers may wonder how to begin philosophis-
ing. Ill put forward some tips/ideas as an amateur in

imagination and our

theoretical

 Operational Research Society.

the last section before concluding this editorial whose
to
sole ambition is to question and inspire, not
demonstrate.

If these reasons and ways to be critical are relevant,
philosophy desperately needs to be brought back into
our IS education and thinking. Hence this Special
Issue of EJIS. I highly recommend reading the intro-
duction by the guest editors, Nik Hassan,
John
Mingers and Bernd Stahl before continuing to read
this editorial which is conceived more as furthering a
conversation based on their points than as a scholarly
contribution. As you will see, I am asking questions
more than providing answers, while their editorial
does provide some answers. They not only did a
great job of marshalling and editing these papers,
and developing many others which we hope will
continue their development and be published in
EJIS or other journals, but their paper also provides
an introduction to what philosophy is and to which
domains it covers that are particularly relevant to IS
(ie, metaphysics, epistemology, rationality, and axiol-
ogy). Bringing philosophy back to IS is an important
condition if we want to be equipped for developing
arguments that increase the likelihood of contribut-
ing to the challenges that society is facing. If we are
capable of doing so without neglecting other compe-
tencies that we have already developed, we will also
considerably increase the likelihood of contributing
to a constructive dialogue with other disciplines and
to be recognised as such. My rst overall goal in this
epilogue is to suggest that we need to embrace all four
broad domains of philosophy and not just focus
mostly on epistemology. Taken together the intro-
duction and the set of papers of this issue indicates
that this is feasible. My second objective is to high-
light some limitations of the positivist worldview
which still drives IS research. It prevents us from
dealing with the situations we encounter in our
world of digital transformation. I am not trying to
settle this argument but am simply arguing for a
change towards a philosophy-based embedded dis-
course if we want IS scholarship to be relevant and
critical. This is one of our two pronged strategies for
pushing IS research to the edges (Grover & Lyytinen,
2015; Rowe, 2011). I am just trying here to spell out
the rationale for
it
should be.

strategy as clearly as

this

2. Unprecedented challenges to societal
values related to digital transformation:
liberty, equality, fraternity

We need to be critical because, in our age of digital
transformation, society faces considerable challenges
and risks related to its core values. R&D spending on
computing and telecommunications has fuelled techno-
logical changes in society and related problems at
unprecedented speed and scale, while research in social
sciences and humanities to study the uses of technology
with the complexity of its eects and implications for
society has not received reasonable support, eort and
funding (Robbin, 2011). IS researchers know that these
eects are not caused by information technologies alone
but are partly shaped by socio-economic relations
(Allmer, Sevignani, & Prodnik, 2015). However,
it
remains dicult not to believe that the systems which
we use daily are implicated in the changes and chal-
lenges of our current world. This is a world that runs at
internet speed, where individuals are becoming heavily
dependent on technologies, if not addicted to some of
them, to the point that the most powerful democracies
can be manipulated by foreign powers (see Hassan,
Mingers, & Stahl, 2018). We give away our self-
awareness to machines like Alexia and our smart houses
erode our self-awareness. Moreover, while IS research-
ers are aware that technology can have unintended
consequences, we tend to see technology as a solution,
not the cause of problems. We can ask the question:
What can IS research do to respond to such issues for
the betterment of the world we live in and its future
(Chiasson, Davidson, & Winter, 2018)? But we must
also see that this requires the development of dialectical
reasoning and reexivity (Cecez-Cekmanovic, 2010),
lest we fall into the trap of Science without conscious-
ness is the ruin of the soul (Rabelais, 1964, p. 137).

The dilemma(s) we face are about the values that
we choose. Todays obvious lesson is that tech giants
not only watch us, but they then apply what we preach
in IS, ie, develop agile apps and digital platforms in
ways that sense and respond to our needs and create
business value (Sambamurthy, Bharadwaj, & Grover,
2003). Further, they learn more about us the more we
use their platforms in order to accumulate the highest
possible value. If we are becoming pawns fascinated by
technologies that are slowly enslaving us for the ben-
ets of a few, it might be too late for a new Jaccuse of
digital capitalism (Grimshaw, 2018) and of a surveil-
lance society (Zubo, 2015). Whatever the truth of
these statements, digital transformation is questioning
our values. Whatever our political preferences, our
responsibility as academics is to reect more about
the personal, collective, and societal risks associated
with digital transformation, and to call into question
the prevailing utilitarian or libertarian thinking to
invite new ways to exert
look at problems that

responsibilities when innovating (Stahl, 2012). Norms
and values are important (Mingers, 1980), and whereas
risks appear at all levels, the greatest diculties lie at
the collective and, in particular, at the societal level
where individuals cannot do much by themselves.

Liberty in the motto of the French Republic and the
rst Amendment of the Bill of Rights to the US
Constitution which protects free speech are exemplars
of how freedom is important to us, to society. But
these values are being questioned, perhaps even mod-
ied by our individual and collective relationship to
technology. On the one hand, freedom of expression
seems to be reinforced by microblogging, voting plat-
forms and online forums as well as email campaigns
which put local to global in a heartbeat (Shirky,
2008, p. 12); and where avatars enable us to express
certain thoughts and facets of our hidden personality
and of the life that we live in cyberspace (Schultze,
2014). Is this a sign of empowerment and emancipa-
tion (Benkler, 2006), or participatory exploitation, as
Marxist analysts would argue (Allmer et al., 2015), in
which behaviours and systems are strategically induced
by the Tech Giants and other powers to exploit indi-
viduals for nancial benet? On the other hand,
whereas the risks of being manipulated by fake news
are as old as philosophy (Goldstein, 2018), new risks
appear such as cyberstalking (Tow, Dell, & Venable,
2010) and phishing (Moody, Galetta, & Dunn, 2017).
What is certainly new is the scale and speed at which
these risks manifest themselves. Globalisation adds a
systemic element to these multiple and data-related
risks (Zubo, 2015). Even if these risks are major, we
can learn to protect ourselves and to manage them.
More importantly however, some threats are internal
to ourselves, in the sense that if we collectively do not
cultivate critical thinking and see the dangers ahead,
it wont be easy to protect ourselves. Whereas tools
can help us full our need for individuation, we
may become gradually and insidiously enslaved by
e-reputation systems or handheld personal tools that
atter our will to power (Nietzche, 1910). For any new
technology weve long known that we can observe
risks and benets and can become pessimistic or opti-
mistic because they exhibit good and dark sides
depending on use and context. We have learned that
many eects are emergent, in the sense that they are
not foreseeable, which runs against the promise of a
computer controlled society (Beniger, 1986), in the
sense that our actions are under control because they
can be programmed/planned, traced and checked by
computers. However, governments have not heard or
most probably do not want to hear this lesson. The
the no touch (contactless) society in
project of
Denmark shows that technological fascination and
vested interests are still dominant and that the project
of a control society is still alive, despite evidence such
total control and
as hacking demonstrating that

privacy
(Ngwenyama,
Henriksen, & Hardt, under review). If the unforesee-
able eects of technology limit the control that is
possible, then why do we need to worry? The short
answer is: (a) because by denition control unduly
limits our freedom and may exclude people and (b)
is not exercised transparently. But
because control
what if these unforeseeable eects are in fact related
to monitoring exerted by the very few who manipulate
the action dynamics (Zubo, 2015)? Even absent of
any instrumental action, what about exclusion eects 
of the elderly or the handicapped for example  of a
contactless society? Behind the trend of personalisation
of tools and systems (Baskerville, 2011) and the myriad
control and articial intelligence tools that we have
created,
freedom and
autonomy.

there is a debate about

Freedom to express ones views, to be informed, to
communicate, to possess, to travel is, in a word, freedom
to act. For philosophers of action, to act is to do some-
thing voluntarily (Juarrero, 2002). The IS literature has
long considered mandatory vs voluntary use of systems
(Brown, Massey, Montoya-Weiss, & Burkman, 2002)
without going far enough in terms of what this means,
except in rare exceptions such as those considering dis-
ciplined empowerment (Elmes, Strong, & Volko, 2005).
When things become programmed, willingness to
choose can become delegated to the machine or to agents
who may then act based on decision rules provided by
the machine without knowing how the decision was
made. Hence the debate on close vs open code (Lessig,
1999) also referred to as transparency of algorithms
(Kononenko, 2001). What will happen with the myriad
complex services that will be oered with the Internet of
Things (Oberlnder, Rglinger, Rosemann, & Kees,
2017)? Nietzche and Hegel have very profoundly
reected on the dangers of delegating tasks between
humans (Kain, 1996) that we can apply to our relation-
ships with machines. The slave through his work makes
his master dependent on him; and those who think they
are the master may, in reality, become the slave. Not only
are we naked without our IT prostheses, but we do not
control what they do in certain situations. Some would
say, Fine, we have to live with our age. But what if,
without knowledge or control and consent, machines
destroy others lives, others economies, or degrade our
natural environments? How do we conceptualise our
autonomy with respect to autonomous vehicles and
automated trading systems which, by denition, learn
and take decisions, which in turn can, if learning is
signicant, put us in unprecedented or unanticipated
dangerous social situations without our consent? Our
freedom is and has to be limited for moral reasons,
because our freedom should not be exerted at the
expense of others freedom. Hence Kants conceptualisa-
tion of autonomy as self-imposition of the moral law
(Kant, 1785/2011): A rational will must be regarded as

autonomous, or free, in the sense of being the author
of the law that binds it. The fundamental principle of
morality  the Categorical imperative  is none other
than the law of an autonomous will (Johnston, 2016).
This law contains two components: the independence of
ones deliberation and choice from manipulation by
others and the capacity to rule oneself (Dworkin, 1988).
Autonomy can be used to refer both to the global con-
dition (autonomous personhood) and to a more local
notion (Christman, 2015) such as autonomy when
equipped with a smartphone. How and to what extent
can we exert our autonomy? Are free will and constraints
on human behaviour arising from neuronal forces com-
patible (Ellis, Murphy, & OConnor, 2009; Mckenna &
Coates, 2015)?

If our freedom and actions become limited by
systems, so that we consider agency leaning towards
the technology side, technology acquires autonomy
(Markus & Rowe, in press). Does it mean human
autonomy is diminished? IT also enables new actions.
Humans may still have agency in systems which allow
agency to both humans and bots for separate tasks.
Usually we discuss autonomy as an issue for human
subjects. Now, what does it mean for technology to be
free? How can technology identify a moral law, if any;
or put dierently, can computers act as moral agents
(Stahl, 2004)? And if we reject technologys autonomy
how do we ascribe responsibility to humans or orga-
nisations and conceptualise governance in such an
automated world (Leclercq-Vandelannoitte & Bertin,
2018)? Regardless of the position we take on causality
and what legal dispositions prevail, these questions
depend on principles regarding what is action, inten-
tion, will, responsibility, autonomy  all concepts that
have been best delineated and discussed by moral
philosophy (or ethics), particularly since Kant and
by the philosophy of action (Juarrero, 2002), and
not much considered as yet by IS research except in
very specialised journals.

Thus, if digitalisation of society is questioning our
values such as freedom, we see that reasoning criti-
cally about these questions is inuenced by philoso-
phy. On issues like security (control) and privacy,
Lowry, Dinev, and Willison (2017) consider the
ethics of artefacts as a fundamental element for IS
research, albeit not always taken into account. In fact
I would claim that philosophy always inuence IS
work but the way in which it does this is seldom
for practical reasons
made explicit. I know that
related to length of papers and time constraints, we
neglect this. But by doing so we espouse a tradition,
which has implicit or explicit assumptions that we are
often not even aware of. We cannot escape philoso-
phising, even if most of the time, we as IS researchers,
do not build explicitly on philosophy. When we
dont, this blinds us, and it would be better to make
explicit on what (strand of) philosophy we are basing

ISD method, etc.
(Hirschheim, Klein, & Lyytinen, 1995)? But let me
nish my story about how digitalisation of society is
questioning our values and why better critical reason-
ing invites philosophising.

for

What did equality mean for the rst article of the
Declaration of the Rights of the Man and the Citizen
the rst article of
in 1789,
the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 by the United
Nations, or for Kant in his Groundwork of the meta-
physics of morals? Whatever their dierences in terms
of natural talent, men share equal dignity. Social
distinctions can only be founded on common utility,
states the rst article of the Declaration. This also
meant, after the talents parable in Matthew 25
(1430) (Harrington, 1991), that the natural aristo-
cratic order was over. Dignity was to be gained by
work, by labour (Ferry, 2014) through autonomy and
creativity. Autonomy is needed, because we face
necessity (and again we cannot completely delegate
our share unless we enslave ourselves). Creativity is
needed, because through work, we participate in the
creation of the world that we inhabit. A caveat, how-
ever: creativity works for both good and evil as the
myth of Prometheus tells us. Work is normal because
our human condition is to work, even if it is hard and
resembles labour (St Paul): all men must gain their
dignity. In the Benedictine monasteries ora et labora
is the rule because to work is to avoid all sorts of
vices, especially laziness and hubris. In a society
where bots execute more and more tasks, how do
people, highly qualied or not, access work or keep
their job and therefore exert their equality in dignity?
For Marxist analysts, digital labour can be seen as
reproducing power structures and unequally distrib-
uted life chances (Allmer et al., 2015; Bergvall-
Kreborn & Howcroft, 2014), if not by reinforcing
them to the benet of the platform owners (Fuchs &
Sevignani, 2013). They distinguish, digital
labour
toil  a form oered by the logic of capitalism 
from playful digital work in line with the logic of
the commons (Fuchs & Sevignani, 2013). For philo-
sophers like Kant or Serres, technology is neutral. We
cannot just say that technology eliminates work; it is
society and institutions that shape such choices
(Kreps, 2018) and can make them good or evil, and
human beings more or less equals in dignity.

Many modern nations and regimes have advocated
praising liberty and equality while privileging one a
little more over the other, thus leading towards more
libertarian or more egalitarian societies (Stone, 2001).
Socialist regimes advocate the removal of inequalities

too-
individualistic society, if we forget Kants categorical
imperative, present in the Declaration of human and
citizen rights, individual liberty could cause harm to
others. While the ideas of liberty and equality were
part of the Enlightenment, another political philoso-
phy seems to have made its way over the last two
centuries: utilitarianism, which states that the proper
course of action is the one that maximises utility and
benets the majority. Utilitarianism, also called con-
sequentialism (Mingers & Walsham, 2010), can be
considered ethically weak because it is insensitive to
rights. However, as advocated by Bentham and Mills
in the nineteenth century, utilitarianism can be con-
sidered a fundamental instrument for justifying deci-
sions of a technological society, a society that believes
in technical progress. Such an approach, based as it is
on methodological individualism, can become dan-
gerous if the majority is blind to its potential dangers
or is manipulated by a few. To counter such perils,
including those of collective regimes that could go
too far on equality and those of liberal regimes that
could go too far on liberty, revolutionaries added a
third value to bind the rst two together: fraternity,
which includes both Philadelphia (brotherly love) and
Adelphotes (community of brothers).

For Arendt, human fallibility in the execution of a
contract is the price of freedom. The impossibility of
perfect control within a community of equals is the
consequence of plurality and reality. . . the joy of
inhabiting together a world whose reality is guaran-
teed for each by the presence of all [. . .] In contrast
Varians vision of a computer-mediated world strikes
me as an arid wasteland  not a community of equals
bound through law in the inevitable and ultimately
fruitful human struggle with uncertainty. (Zubo,
2015, p. 81)

Is digitalisation moving individuals and society towards
wider social identity? and fraternity? Let us consider
two brief examples: social media and interaction with
robots, whether mediated by experts or not. Some may
consider that any platform that allows people to com-
municate together is an important path towards recog-
nising each other and fraternity. On the other hand,
when we experience negative behaviours on social
media, we may view these platforms as being used
more in the pursuit of private interests and to monetise
our personal data, which runs counter to augmenting
trust and possible fraternity. A deeper philosophical
explanation interprets social media behaviours as either
instrumental communication at play, as described by
Habermas or Gomann, or as a Bourdieusian pursuit of
social, and possibly economic, capital (Qi, Monod,
Fang, & Deng, 2018). Alternatively, one can question
whether attitudes and behaviours on such platforms

384

EPILOGUE

reect a need to search for oneself, to which Sartres
philosophy is appropriate or Heideggers notions of
shared-world and being with others (Qi et al., 2018).
Levinass philosophy could also be explored as explain-
ing the diculties rather than the desire for social media
(Introna & Brigham, 2007). Going beyond the usual
psychological approaches to explain and discuss tech-
nological choices, philosophy can thus help interpret
the good and dark sides of behaviours at the societal
level, such as how and why we associate IT artefact with
certain values (eg, social media with fraternity) and
hence enable us to re-conceptualise the IT artefact
(Cheikh-Ammar, 2018).

Similarly, interactions with robots can aect our
feelings of fraternity. Robots can replace humans for
dicult or dangerous tasks, or cooperate with humans;
this is the promise of the interesting concept of cobo-
tics. Bots can be also useful as agents when humans
cannot be present. However, fraternity is not enhanced
when people interact with machines. And we experi-
ence social isolation when relating with machines takes
up most of our time (Kreps, 2018). On the contrary, our
humanity and fraternity are enhanced when we have in-
depth relationships with other humans, when we spend
time with them, when we show signs of caring and
compassion. Social recognition is a precondition for
human relationships and fraternity. Social recognition
cannot be imparted to robots or voice servers, despite
the extensive progress made by articial intelligence for
personal identication. Hence, the human preference
for face-to-face interactions, even when there are no
cognition problems with user-friendly machines
(Rowe & Limayem, 1999). This is why organisations
using articial intelligence have understood that it is
preferable that messages continue to be presented by
employees to customers. The selection process, the
denition of targets that can be attracted by mass cus-
tomisation oerings,
is assigned to bots, but it is
humans who make contact so that customers perceive
the targeting process as not so mechanistic.

Returning once again to the notion of fraternity:
machines currently have no capacity to compute
meaning, because meaning is not strictly the applica-
tion of rules to transform some symbols into other
symbols (Searle, 1980). It is about understanding
what one is doing (Obermeier, 1983). There is no
human-machine communication of meanings in a
conversation of humans with machines. The general
problem of supplying thoughts to Articial Agents,
can only be addressed when, rst,
the Symbol
Grounding Problem is solved, thereby giving con-
cepts
to the manipulated symbols, and second,
when articial consciousness is achieved, thereby giv-
ing intentionality to those manipulated symbols
(Rodriguez, Hermosillo, & Lara, 2012). Articial
intelligence techniques use voice and image recogni-
tion, but they do not identify a person per se. Plato

asked: how do we identify each other as a person, as
humans? And he answered that it was not by sense
impression (Whitaker, 1996), but by recognising our
Being or Oneness with the other (McDowell, 1973).
When articial intelligence diagnoses a dicult case
or situation, to what extent will the human justify a
the human appears only as machine
decision if
appendage? Indeed, we may still assume that the
human will have to do the work, at least in certain
critical situations to which we are particularly sensi-
tive. Even if Watson proves much more reliable and
eective in identifying tumours and cancers than
radiologists, will the radiologists just endorse the
machine diagnosis without independently checking
to conrm it? In other words, while the costs of
reliable predictions based on articial
intelligence
drop, the need for advanced human judgment skills
sensitive bad news
may grow, especially about
(Agrawal, Gans, & Goldfarb, 2018). What we have
learnt about more classical decision support systems
(Rowe, 2006) still holds, except that here we are
talking about human life. In fact, many patients
may well not accept the machines diagnosis without
the assessment and conrmation of
their doctor
(Farajallah, Le Go-Pronost, Penard, & Suire, 2015).
If doctors conrm that their ex post-diagnosis agrees
with Watsons, why and how would they invest in
such aid? And if the two diagnoses are contradictory,
doctors may be put in a very dicult position. Such
situations are complex and show that even though
deep learning has made great advances, there is still a
long way before a machine can completely replace
health professionals and patients or doctors will com-
pletely trust a machine.

So far we have discussed how IT might inuence the
values on which the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was founded in 1948. IT is also supporting evol-
ving values such as control or security as noticed above as
well as collaboration and non-possession with the rise of
the sharing economy (Belk, 1988). Whether the latter is
reinforcing fraternity among humans or indicates a
growing concern for sustainability or simple economic
rationality is an interesting avenue for IS research.
More radical advances in IT and biotechnologies might
have a more disruptive eect on our values. The trans-
humanist dream to extend life by a hundred years by
replacing entire human organs as they age can be inter-
preted as adding eternity to Enlightenment values. It can
also be seen as playing God, like Prometheus who was
punished for his theft of re, but also for having stolen
Athenas powers to create the arts and all sorts of articial
artefacts. As described in the Book of Genesis, this is the
capital sin, the hubris of wanting to play God or to
become Homo Deus (Harari, 2015). Just as importantly,
this would lead to society, as in Greek cosmology, of
eternals (gods) and mortals  indeed, a mortal breach
in the notion of fraternity and equality.

Even if all these technologies, including articial
intelligence, are a long way from the point at which
the above statements could be anywhere close to
some reality, the minimum we owe our students
and children is to say that caution and philosophical
thinking are in order! We wont be credible if we say
we could not know, even if in truth we do not now
know. What is clear is that most of the questions I
have too quickly raised in this section are complex
and far beyond the simple constructs that we use in
our usual IS research papers. We must return to
philosophy to engage with the complexity of the
world we live in to conceptualise issues and what
they can mean for dierent stakeholders.

3. Bringing metaphysics back to engage with
axiology

As argued by the guest editors, serious questions
require serious examination of even harder questions.
While the IS discipline has made major eorts and
contributed in the domain of epistemology and meth-
odology, I would argue that we still need to do much
more on the three other domains of philosophy pre-
sented by the guest editors: metaphysics, rationality,
and axiology. While there has been some work on
ethics, Nik Hassan, John Mingers and Bernd Stahl
underscore that IS research needs to be engaged with
the many risks related to digital transformation. This
takes us into the realm of values. Axiology is a vast
domain, but to treat its issues seriously we need a
strong intellectual basis in metaphysics (Hassan et al.,
2018; Kreps, 2018). And to begin with, who are we
to have values? What is a human being? Philosophy
of Mind is important because it addresses the ques-
tions of consciousness,
language, and reason. For
Aristotle and Descartes body and mind/soul were
distinct. While Kant kept this distinction, for some
revolutionaries of the Enlightenment, Soul is a vain
notion (La Mettrie, 1753). Being a machine, know-
ing how to distinguish good from evil, being born
with intelligence and a reliable instinct of moral, and
being an animal are things that are not more contra-
dictory than being a monkey or a parrot and giving
oneself pleasure (p. 34), Mettrie believed. Man is a
machine. . . a substance (p. 37), he proposed, and
this view is mirrored in some eliminative material-
ist philosophies of the twentieth century such as
especially
those
Churchland, for whom consciousness is mere electro-
eervescent delusion. Such behaviourist and materi-
alist goals of reducing the mental to the physical, of
course, tend to result in absurdity, damaging both
our idea of what the mind is and what the physical
universe constitutes. Such views are countered by a
range of other philosophers and positions, including
for whom our

and how we

subjectivity is undeniably real,
for whom human
awareness and experience are more than a mere
pack of neurons (Libet, 2005, p. 5), and for whom
some more dualist or idealist position must be found.
Discussing such ontological questions is critical for
IS research, but we should also explore other forms of
realism than critical realism, such as embodied rea-
lism and speculative realism, as well as diverse types
of idealism. Embodied realism oers potential for
cognition, the design of human-computer interfaces,
neuro IS and modelling, among other domains where
there is direct application in IS, because it explains
why we use metaphors
reason
causally (Lako & Johnson, 1999; Markus & Rowe,
in press). In fact, embodied realism can be considered
as a revolution regarding many entrenched beliefs in
philosophical systems based on recent discoveries of
cognitive sciences, such as the inherently embodied
mind (against Cartesian and Kantian dualism), the
mostly unconscious mind and reasoning, and the
metaphorical character of abstract concepts. As a
consequence of this embodiment, the mind cannot
be known simply by self-reection. This justies
empirical research, but also has consequences for
morality
realism
(Harman, 2010; Meillassoux, 2010), which builds on
Latour, who himself builds on Whitehead, is promis-
ing for those who question sociomaterial interactions.
Whiteheads process-relational cosmology (ontology)
(Whitehead, 1929) builds on Bergsons notion of time
and is an important intellectual source for at
ontologies, applicable to worlds where processes
involve
and emerging wholes
(Markus & Rowe, in press) not dierent in ontologi-
cal status (De Landa, 2002), and for thinking about
inuential thinkers for IS research like Latour (Kreps,
2018). In his polemic Against Nature, Kreps (2018)
brilliantly demonstrates how strongly IS research has
been and still is inuenced by a positivist view of the
world, which insists on methodological individual-
ism, and which screens out the reality of subjective
consciousness, pretends that the rational agent user
is an apolitical and atheoretical depiction of
the
human condition, rather than a specic tool of neo-
classical economic theory and neoliberal politics
(p. 97), and negates the myriad relationships that
exist in a world that is becoming. Instead, Kreps
to borrow from Bergsons and
(2018) proposes
Whiteheads process-relational philosophy,
from
moral philosophy and from complexity theory, to
claim that the libertarian argument for the neoliberal
digital capitalist society runs counter to the reality of
the natural world of which we are a part.

interacting parts

Journal articles cannot do justice to such rich trans-
disciplinary work, but it is important to note here, that
in the eyes of Bergson and Whitehead, all matter and
subjectivity are interrelated in an ongoing processual

ow and that interpretivism is closer to reality than
positivism. From an axiological perspective, much
must be held in common (Kreps, 2018, p. 82).
Blondel was born in 1861 like Whitehead and died 2
years after him in 1949. They did not know each other,
but they both constructed a cosmology which strives
to answer the question of how freedom of the indivi-
dual is compatible with the idea that each person is
related through numerous linkages to all other beings
and, even, to the entire universe. Put otherwise, how
can we understand that the greater the density of the
network that relates this real entity to the universe, the
more its individuation is complete? The universe is
one continuous energy soup where dierences are
only distinguishable by density and perspective of the
viewer. We are constantly exchanging energy with
the Sun, the Earth, all the galaxies and black holes in
a time-space continuum. Such views relate science,
metaphysics and theology. In particular, Whiteheads
cosmology has far-reaching consequences which chal-
lenge our notion of a stable relationship between
object and attribute, what in design science research
we also model as ontologies and implement in rela-
tional databases (Giacomoni & Sardas, 2014). Based on
the scientic knowledge of the twentieth century the
embodied realism of Lako and Johnson and the
cosmologies of Blondel and Whitehead oer very dif-
ferent ontologies of the world which challenge ethical
knowledge and responsibilities.

4. Philosophising because theory
development requires metatheories and
intuition

These glimpses of how philosophy can help IS
research face our societal challenges through axiology
and metaphysics also have consequences for episte-
mology and rationality. We certainly need philosophy
because we rst need to ground the knowledge we
produce in epistemology, a branch of philosophy
which discusses the validity conditions of the produc-
tion of scientic knowledge (Lee, 2004).

First, axiology is invited in epistemology when we
use a critical theoretical methodology and take a value
position to challenge the status quo as recommended
by Myers and Klein (2011) as one of the six principles
for conducting critical social research. Critical research
is a quest against injustice and undue limitations of
freedom, which calls for a methodology dierent from
an interpretive methodology that interprets values but
does not challenge the status quo (Cecez-Cekmanovic,
2010; Rowe, 2009). The Critical social sciences [. . .]
require normative theoretical foundations and a dif-
ferent research methodology to deal with moral and
normative-ethical questions to pursue emancipatory
interests (Cecez-Cekmanovic, 2010, p. 4). This is
necessary for both individual emancipation and for

societal
issues
improvement. These methodological
are addressed with very dierent arguments by a neo-
humanist strand, largely based on Habermas, which
focuses on denaturalising restrictive forms of
IS
development and use, and by a post-humanist
strand largely based on Foucault, who questions the
humanist assumption of the unied autonomous sub-
ject (Cecez-Cekmanovic, 2010). To Myers and Kleins
six principles, Cecez-Kecmanovic proposes adding the
overarching principle of reexivity and dialectical
reasoning which falls
type of
rationality.

into a dierent

Second, metaphysics, such as those proposed by
Bergson, Blondel and Whitehead as well as speculative
realism by Harman, Meillassoux and others, invites us
to reconsider positively the role of intellectual think-
ing, metatheories, intuition and theoretical reasoning
in the face of what can be perceived as the imperialism
of methodological reason (Aronowitz & Ausch, 2000).
Such reason is rooted in Kant and modern science,
which have retained the knowing subject/object of
knowledge distance, also known as Cartesian dualism.
This culminated with the Vienna circle of logical
empiricists whose primary claim was
to abolish
metatheory, that is, to deny any proposition that
failed the tests of observation and experiment
(Aronowitz & Ausch, 2000, p. 701).
Indeed, by
requiring that all scientic investigation be subject
to falsication, positivism restricted scientic inquiry
to objects whose propositions and observational state-
ments can be operationalised in methodological terms.
[. . .] Thinking a world beyond-the-given became rele-
gated to non-Anglo-American philosophy. (idem,
p. 702). Retroductive process in Critical realism is an
eort to infer a causal mechanism to explain the given
empirical phenomenon and thus develops a theorising
that goes beyond (Williams & Wynn, 2018). However,
unlike Bhaskar, the way critical realism is mainly
applied in social sciences, management, and IS has a
strong empirical focus, and is not oriented towards a
metatheoretical construction and a new philosophy for
what Langefors (1980) called our infological world. A
philosophical discussion based on critical realism
would be to discuss intransitive structures (Mingers,
2014). Another way to go beyond the given is by
developing justied (!) models of possible future
worlds (Frank, 2006; Rorty, 1999) that serve those
who live the future as an inspiration, and a meaningful
orientation. The respective constructions cannot be
invalidated by confronting them with empirical data,
because they are purposefully dierent from reality.
(Olbrich, Frank, Gregor, Niederman, & Rowe, 2017).
Aronowitz and Ausch follow Feyerabends (1998)
and Kuhns critique of Popper in arguing against posi-
tivist methodologies. They rst consider solutions that
other social scientists have brought to the subject-
object dualism. They present two main approaches of

hermeneutic and phenomenology, both of which have
been adopted in IS research. While introducing a
principle of interaction between researchers and actors
(eg, Klein & Myers, 1999), Aronowitz and Ausch con-
tend that hermeneutic approaches in social sciences
are also dominated by method. This is not the case
with Alford (1998). He puts on par evidence and
theory and shows that there is always a choice in
terms of
theorising between putting emphasis on
explaining what happened, emphasising the meanings
and tracing historically the events, but that all three
aspects should be involved, as demonstrated using
masterpieces of the founding fathers of sociology:
Durkheim, Marx, and Weber. For Alford the task of
the researcher is to choose which one of the three will
be in the foreground while including the other two in
the background. In a given inquiry, these three aspects
of theoretical development are necessary, but not of
equal importance depending on theoretical choice.

that

tradition is

With phenomenology, the critique of positivism is
more radical because it not only rejects dualism, it
advocates a knowing that is inherently individually
subjective. Social objects are always
interpreted,
and these interpretations are always mediated by
metatheories which are generally ignored and
must be revealed. However, Aronowitz and Ausch
the risk posed by
(2000, p. 712) recognise that
theory
the phenomenological
development becomes so important that it loses the
concrete historicity of the object to be studied. In
their essay (Aronowitz & Ausch, 2000) opt, along
with Feyerabend and a rich philosophical tradition,
for a position where social knowledge can be derived
without method. They propose an onto-historical
paradigm based on a dierent understanding of
objectivity: A historically situated and oscillating
Being is the case, not the divided subject/object
(p. 713).
Inspired by Sartre, Spinoza, Deleuze,
Adorno and many others, they claim that engage-
ment with the complex and mostly messy world and
its history and [of] the body with its intuitive tenta-
cles, constitute an adequate basis for knowledge
(p. 717). By a single stroke [science] claimed to
sweep away the tradition of a hundred thousand
years, which had become one with human nature
itself. It wrote an end to the ancient animist covenant
between man and nature, leaving nothing in place of
that precious bond but an anxious quest in a frozen
universe of solitude. [. . .] [Science] has however com-
mended recognition, but

perceive something, to be aware of an object, as
phenomenology argues. While Blondel wants
to
ground his philosophy on science, he criticises the
incapacity of science to seize the unity of Being in
evolution. As claimed by Aristotle, we can also
acquire knowledge by intuition.
Intuition stems
from what we experience and theorise and is beyond
the analytical processes of science (Klein & Rowe,
2008; Schwartz, 2011), such as dierentiation or frac-
talisation (as described by Kuhn (Tarafdar &
Davison, in press)).

Ultimately, this is why, although counter to the
dominant paradigm, theory development and metathe-
ories are needed. To advance research requires adding
value on at least one of the two levels, theoretical
or empirical. I would argue that in IS, because we
are strong in methods and confront phenomena
where empirical richness seems to expand like the uni-
verse, we too often neglect to develop our theoretical
reasoning and conceptual reasoning based on intuition
(Stahl, 2014). Hence, the need for pure theory develop-
ment papers in our preferred set of genres of papers
(Teeni, Rowe, gerfalk, & Lee, 2015)!

5. Critique is in our mission, and society
expects it for deliberating about action

Being critical is part of the mission of all scholars,
and explicitly of those of us who publish in EJIS. This
is not just an issue for research and theoretical rea-
soning, which deals with epistemology and concerns
all scientists, but of practical reasoning that would
benet both our students and society when question-
ing how agents deliberate about action (Wallace,
2014). Reecting about practical reasoning in specic
circumstances of everyday life, at work or in private
life, falls in the domain of the philosophy of action.
Unlike theoretical reason,

Practical reason, by contrast, is concerned not with
the truth of propositions but with the desirability or
value of actions. [. . .] Practical reason takes a dis-
tinctively normative question as its starting point. It
typically asks, of a set of alternatives for action none
of which has yet been performed, what one ought to
do, or what it would be best to do. [. . .] The contrast
between practical and theoretical reason is essentially
a contrast between two dierent systems of norms:
those for the regulation of action on the one hand,
and those for the regulation of belief on the other.
[. . .] Theoretical reasoning leads to modications of
our beliefs, whereas practical reasoning leads to
modications of our

intentions

Like Aronowitz and Ausch, we do not claim that we
should stop publishing non-critical papers. This
would be unrealistic, but also foolish, because the
reviewing process brings a critique, and such papers,
when published in good journals can be considered as

388

having epistemic validity, even when they do not
inscribe themselves in some critical thinking. My
frustration with non-critical research is related to
the often limited contributions these approaches
oer in practice, both in terms of theorising (as
demonstrated in the case of positivist research by
Grover and Lyytinen (2015) and in terms of their
practical implications. Hence, my desire for EJIS to
publish a greater proportion of critical papers.
However, I want to emphasise that I do not consider
that non-critical papers cannot make important con-
tributions if they introduce or relax specic con-
straints in their underlying assumptions. In other
words, one can be positivist and critically useful, or
interpretivist and critically useful without espousing
or developing a critical social theory. To begin with
the last combination, any good interpretivist study is
a potential foundation for a critical one taking a value
stance. How can one be both critical and positivist?
For instance, an in-depth utilitarian approach would
be critical and distinguished from mere consequenti-
alism, if it considers the risks and benets for each
type of heterogeneous stakeholders rather than con-
sidering only the eectiveness of proposed solutions
for the majority. This would also suppose that the
hidden costs and risks be revealed to the stakeholders.
In many cases if users knew about the current impli-
cations of their use they might prefer discontinue
using the service and their expressed utility would
change. This would contribute to emancipating we
humans from false consciousness, collective delu-
sions and oppressive ideologies that we have created
(Habermas, 1984). Current revelations on digitalisa-
tion of society suggest that we have a false conscious-
ness, collective delusion, or at least an uncritical
ideological embrace of it (Rosen, 1996).

We also need to develop the critical practical rea-
soning of our students, which will also benet our
stakeholders. With greater professionalisation of
Bachelors and Masters programmes, higher education
has emphasised IS/IT operational knowledge for
higher employability. In a eld where knowledge and
know-how are constantly renewed, this professionali-
sation trend has reached its main goal: students being
quickly recruited. But this has sometimes come at the
expense of critical thinking development which may
be lacking. And that is precisely what recruiters con-
sider
students are missing the most
(Kappelman, Johnson, Torres, Maurer, & Mclean,
under review). There are certainly many ways to
develop critical thinking, but remaining open to dif-
ferent paths oers the best safeguard against research
programmes dead-ends. Learning from our own errors
as well as from others in organisations and society can
be very protable and is at the basis of the teaching
case study method. Accompanied with a base of cri-
tical thinking related to current and past societal

that our

problems, forms of critical practical reasoning can be
developed for decision-making related to investments
and IS development and use (Hirschheim et al., 1995;
Ngwenyama & Klein, in press).

6. How to engage with philosophy (when one
has not been trained in philosophy)?

If youre going to reopen basic philosophical issues,
heres the minimum you have to do. First, you need
a method of investigation. Second, you have to use
that method to understand basic philosophical con-
cepts. Third, you have to apply that method to pre-
vious philosophies to understand what
they are
about and what makes them hang together. And
fourth, you have to use that method to ask the big
questions: What it is to be a person? What is mor-
ality? How do we understand the causal structure of
the universe?. (Lako & Johnson, 1999, p. 8)

Consistently with my caution about the best method
(dont get me wrong, I am not against method; other-
wise, I would not be an academic; but Im against its
supremacy or dogmatic use!) I am not arguing for a
given methodology for philosophising. Philosophising
requires reexivity and freedom. Leibniz recognised
that we should distinguish between the issue of
method of inquiry (how to discover) and method of
exposition or writing (how to expose what we have
learned) which can be typical of a philosophical genre
(Loekmer, 1966). Rather,
I prefer a diversity of
approaches for both and would avoid any strong nor-
mative recommendation of what should be done.
Moreover, because of limited space, let me oer just
a few thoughts.

What can I know and how to investigate it? To
engage with philosophy is to be open and is a matter
of state of mind. The method of enquiry depends on
ones research goal. If you are ready for a long jour-
ney identify the best philosophical system and adjust
it for IS research! Some may prefer to begin studying
a philosophical system which, in the idealist tradition,
generalises a great idea (eg, Kants transcendental
idealism which allows to distinguish dierent episte-
mic trends in IS (Monod, 2003)) or oer an approach
that can be systematically applied to information
system (eg, Pierces triadic sign (Beynon-Davies,
2018), whereas others with a more practical inclina-
tion will look at how philosophy can inform their
problem at hand. They would,  la Aristotle, distin-
guish and relate their problem and issues with what
dierent philosophers may have said about them. It
is with this practical inclination that Lynne Markus
and I worked on our study of causality. Without
espousing any philosophical system, what we took
from analytical philosophy was an ability to interro-
gate our language, whose most radical position is
exemplied by the late Wittgenstein, who considered
that philosophy had nothing else to say, but could

help interrogate our language and logic, ie, our rea-
soning. Philosophy strives to generalise and by this
eort explore the powerfulness of a coherent system
of thought. Whether it is applied to all entities (as in
metaphysics) or only to the issue of language and
scientic language in particular (analytic philosophy)
is what divides continental philosophy from analyti-
cal philosophy.

How can one expose the ndings of ones philoso-
phical investigations? When we in the western world
assert that the Greeks invented philosophy, we in fact
recognise that they developed a method for exposing
and at the same time probing their knowledge. As
mentioned by the guest editors of this Special Issue,
philosophy and science were the same thing, but we
can argue that other civilisation (eg, Egyptian) has
already developed scientic knowledge. What
the
Greek invented was the critical discourse which devel-
ops through dialogue and argumentation (Howland,
argumentation
1992; Nightingale, 2000). Critical
through
self-
exploration about what we know and do has been an
essential part of philosophy throughout Renaissance
(eg, De Montaigne, 1580/2003). Engaging in dialogue
about problems claries discourse, avoids dead-ends
and opens up new perspectives. It is the traditional
method and the Greek heritage for exposing ones
ideas in philosophy which was still used throughout
enlightenment (eg, Diderot, 1785/1999) until today
(Deleuze & Parnet, 1987). This why alternatives genres
(Avital, Mathiassen, & Schultze, 2017), such as polemic
(Walsham, 2010) and theatre (Boland & Lyytinen,
2017) can play an important role for IS research.

open-mindedness,

erudition,

and

Alternatively following Descartes, several philoso-
phical systems have been exposed after the axiomatic
or deductive method. They look for the primary idea,
the idea from which all others derive. The archetypal
exemplar is Spinozas Ethics (not to be confused with a
discourse on morality) in which he uses this Cartesian
method with axioms, theorems, and corollaries to
deduct the essence of all things. This approach was
followed by Fichte, Hegel and Schelling. Malebranche
or Leibniz Theodicies also oer good instantiations of
this analytical method. Game theory can be viewed as a
this method for collective
modern descendent of
choices related to utilitarianism (Burgess, 2005). It has
been applied for modelling specic information system
problems (eg, Galbreth & Shor, 2010). However, cali-
bration and ndings should be discussed in light of
underlying philosophical assumptions of the model
and claims of superiority (such as rule utilitarianism
over act utilitarianism (eg, Burgess, 2005) toned down.
Whether for inquiry or exposition, the method of
philosophising is critical discourse in which members of
the community discuss particulars of challenging exis-
tential issues and hammer out reasoned positions about
them that cannot necessarily be codied in episteme (cf.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

389

Aristotle, 1934; Habermas, 1973; Toulmin, 2009). In
spirit true philosophising never claims to arrive at a
denitive answer (eg, on how to combine causality
positions on various dimensions (Markus & Rowe, in
press), as philosophers of science, notably Kuhn and
Popper, have convincingly argued. This holds even
more true for phenomena we study in IS which involves
studying social phenomena or designing tools for social
actors and belongs to social sciences. While in IS
research there is room for replication and negation
studies following a neo-positivist epistemology, one
could regard replication more broadly in a dierent
epistemological perspective as an integral part of an
ongoing critical discourse. In that sense, replication
would mean starting a discourse on a previous study,
story, scenario, artefact, method etc. and then trying to
validate it by reconstructing its epistemological out-
come (Olbrich et al., 2017). In a way this is the assump-
tion on which Design Science Research is based  the
idea that a designed artefact will replicate its eects
under certain conditions. However, this solution repli-
cation is always questionable in absence of a solid
theoretical framework. This critical argument  in the
narrow sense of epistemic critique  partakes in the
current debate on Design Science Research and its
genres (Peers, Tuunanen, & Niehaves, 2018). It should
nevertheless be furthered beyond a quarrel about the
best methodology and be discussed at the ethical and
metaphysical levels as well to reect a broader critical
discourse (eg, Klein, 1981; Mingers & Walsham, 2010;
Ulrich, 2003), ie, what philosophising is about.

7. Conclusion

Philosophy is the mother of all disciplines (cf. Hassan
et al., 2018). Today it can help IS research nurture itself
and face its most critical challenges related to digital
transformation and beyond. It is intimately tied to our
critical thinking because it proposes dierent thinking
systems, dierent paradigms or worldviews and not just
the three or four usual suspects, such as post-positivism,
critical realism, radical (also called pragmatic) construc-
tivism, interpretivism, we generally encounter in epis-
temology discourses (eg, Avenier & Thomas, 2015).
Any issue or solution can be examined from an onto-
logical (metaphysical), axiological or epistemological
viewpoint,
if not simply from a logical viewpoint,
because we encounter issues with language when we
engage in such knowledge work. Philosophy also pro-
vides a kind of grounding of ideas with insightful syn-
thetic arguments around which several disciplines can
build and confront their own perspectives when they
address complex issues. It enables us to go beyond
specialised traditions for attending to these systemic
Jean-Louis Le Moignes philosopy;
challenges (eg,
Eriksson, 1997). The relative lack of truly interdisciplin-
ary papers in our general IS journals  our so called AIS

390

EPILOGUE

basket of 8  might be partly related to the eorts such
projects require, but also to the fact that philosophy is
rarely invited in such interdisciplinary eorts (Tarafdar
& Davison, in press). IS researchers should view engage-
ment with philosophy as an opportunity. As compared
to other disciplines studying digitalisation, we actually
know a bit and care about technology. This suggests two
things, that (a) we can develop a deeper understanding
and (b) we can actually change the current state of
aairs by designing new IT and digital practices if we
recognise the limitations of our research, risks of what
we propose, and are explicit about our philosophical
assumptions.

Unfortunately, philosophy is a discipline in which
many IS and non-IS researchers are no longer educated
(Stocker, 2018). Management disciplines have elimi-
nated this source, except perhaps philosophy of science.
Returning to this source and reclaiming it would help
us face todays challenges and if we truly interrogate the
limitations of our knowledge. Philosophy is key to
developing the capacity to be critical  a soft skill, the
lack of which worries the recruiters of our students 
because it entails reexivity and helps us to remain
open in the conversation (Gadamer, 1975; Toulmin,
2009). If stakeholders or researchers also look for
emancipation in organisations or society, philosophy
of action and moral philosophy may seem inevitable.
I do not take such a dogmatic stance as I have shown
above while expressing a desire for more critical theory
papers. Any paper built upon a thorough critique,
following the denition proposed at the outset of this
paper, which bears fruit is philosophising and welcome.
We have moved into abstraction (Ciborra, 1998;
Feyerabend, 1999), but we are missing many opportu-
nities to interrogate the richness of the problem space
that digital transformation has created for us. Schutz
and Luckmann (1973) argue for the expansion of
inquiry into aspects of our everyday life (as the pre-
eminent reality) such as the meaning-strata that turns
our material objects (our artefacts) into cultural objects
and infuses our ideas and set the limits of our recipro-
cal action as well as our self-understanding. Many
questions have not been treated because of our neglect
of philosophy. In the last century Heidegger warned in
the Question Concerning Technology (1954):

Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to tech-
nology, whether we passionately arm or deny it.
But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible
way when we regard it as something neutral. [. . .]
Everything depends on our manipulating technology
in the proper manner as a means. We will, as we say,
get technology spiritually in hand. We will master
it. The will to mastery becomes all the more urgent
the more technology threatens to slip from human
control. (Heidegger, 1954, pp. 45)

In order for the IS eld to escape the blinkers that might
be placed on it and in order to produce knowledge that

socially relevant and inuential, our
is original,
researchers need to conceive and explore alternatives
to current ways of thinking. Philosophy oers guidance
along that path (Hassan, 2014). All the reasons for being
critical, whether we like them or not, point to the
necessity of philosophy.

This special issue is not the rst important collective
eort on philosophy by IS researchers which goes
beyond epistemology (eg. Mingers & Willcocks, 2004;
Hirschheim et al. 2011), but I hope that this issue will
help show how interesting and enriching philosophis-
ing can be for IS research. I want to express our most
heartfelt thanks to Bernd, John and Nik, and to all the
authors and reviewers who made this special issue
possible. They demonstrate that philosophising in IS
research is doable, enjoyable, rewarding and that it has
made considerable progress with the support of its
the Association of
Special
Information Systems and as a regular track at ICIS! I
invite the reader to enjoy their introduction to philo-
sophy and its origins, as well as their mapping of
philosophy in four dimensions. Chapeau!

EPILOGUE

Being critical is good, but better with philosophy! From digital transformation
and values to the future of IS research

1. From wishful thinking to motivation:
growing philosophical awareness

Being critical
is a self-directed and self-correcting
capacity to think otherwise about an issue in order
to see the limitations of ones or others past or
present theoretical or practical reasoning about this
issue. In essence, it is about reexivity. In pleading for
being more critical in this editorial that appears as an
epilogue for this Special Issue, I acknowledge my
French inuence and education with an inclination
towards critique and philosophy. The voice of this
epilogue oscillates between the rst person,
thus
reecting a personal opinion and a European and
North American history and a collective voice when
reecting common ground as IT users or as members
of the IS community. Since the editorial where I
expressed my wish for the IS discipline to be more
critical (Rowe, 2010), a number of such papers have
been published in EJIS (eg, Ravishankar, Pan, &
Myers, 2013), notably in the alternative genres
Special Issue and now in this Philosophy Special
Issue. However, I have come to realise the need to
motivate more forcefully this wish for a greater pro-
portion of papers engaged in critique in the above
sense and to show that they require philosophising.

To justify this need for philosophising, I examine
four main reasons to be critical in IS research. First,
the unusual challenges of the digital transformation of
society and related risks invite us to look beyond our
comfort zone, if we want to be able to contribute to
nding solutions and to question values and value
judgments (axiology). Second,
if we take a value
stance, this has implications for methodology (episte-
mology) and the ontology of the world being consid-
ered (metaphysics). Third, philosophising helps us
break out of limitations that unduly restrict our theo-
retical
reasoning
through metatheories and intuition (theoretical ration-
ality). Fourth, we should develop critical
thinking,
covering both theoretical and practical reasoning to
pursue our mission in ways that help students be up
to the demands of their future jobs and meet industry
expectations (practical rationality). The outline of this
editorial will address these reasons in turn. However,
while these reasons motivate engaging in philosophy,
IS researchers may wonder how to begin philosophis-
ing. Ill put forward some tips/ideas as an amateur in

imagination and our

theoretical

 Operational Research Society.

the last section before concluding this editorial whose
to
sole ambition is to question and inspire, not
demonstrate.

If these reasons and ways to be critical are relevant,
philosophy desperately needs to be brought back into
our IS education and thinking. Hence this Special
Issue of EJIS. I highly recommend reading the intro-
duction by the guest editors, Nik Hassan,
John
Mingers and Bernd Stahl before continuing to read
this editorial which is conceived more as furthering a
conversation based on their points than as a scholarly
contribution. As you will see, I am asking questions
more than providing answers, while their editorial
does provide some answers. They not only did a
great job of marshalling and editing these papers,
and developing many others which we hope will
continue their development and be published in
EJIS or other journals, but their paper also provides
an introduction to what philosophy is and to which
domains it covers that are particularly relevant to IS
(ie, metaphysics, epistemology, rationality, and axiol-
ogy). Bringing philosophy back to IS is an important
condition if we want to be equipped for developing
arguments that increase the likelihood of contribut-
ing to the challenges that society is facing. If we are
capable of doing so without neglecting other compe-
tencies that we have already developed, we will also
considerably increase the likelihood of contributing
to a constructive dialogue with other disciplines and
to be recognised as such. My rst overall goal in this
epilogue is to suggest that we need to embrace all four
broad domains of philosophy and not just focus
mostly on epistemology. Taken together the intro-
duction and the set of papers of this issue indicates
that this is feasible. My second objective is to high-
light some limitations of the positivist worldview
which still drives IS research. It prevents us from
dealing with the situations we encounter in our
world of digital transformation. I am not trying to
settle this argument but am simply arguing for a
change towards a philosophy-based embedded dis-
course if we want IS scholarship to be relevant and
critical. This is one of our two pronged strategies for
pushing IS research to the edges (Grover & Lyytinen,
2015; Rowe, 2011). I am just trying here to spell out
the rationale for

2. Unprecedented challenges to societal
values related to digital transformation:
liberty, equality, fraternity

We need to be critical because, in our age of digital
transformation, society faces considerable challenges
and risks related to its core values. R&D spending on
computing and telecommunications has fuelled techno-
logical changes in society and related problems at
unprecedented speed and scale, while research in social
sciences and humanities to study the uses of technology
with the complexity of its eects and implications for
society has not received reasonable support, eort and
funding (Robbin, 2011). IS researchers know that these
eects are not caused by information technologies alone
but are partly shaped by socio-economic relations
(Allmer, Sevignani, & Prodnik, 2015). However,
it
remains dicult not to believe that the systems which
we use daily are implicated in the changes and chal-
lenges of our current world. This is a world that runs at
internet speed, where individuals are becoming heavily
dependent on technologies, if not addicted to some of
them, to the point that the most powerful democracies
can be manipulated by foreign powers (see Hassan,
Mingers, & Stahl, 2018). We give away our self-
awareness to machines like Alexia and our smart houses
erode our self-awareness. Moreover, while IS research-
ers are aware that technology can have unintended
consequences, we tend to see technology as a solution,
not the cause of problems. We can ask the question:
What can IS research do to respond to such issues for
the betterment of the world we live in and its future
(Chiasson, Davidson, & Winter, 2018)? But we must
also see that this requires the development of dialectical
reasoning and reexivity (Cecez-Cekmanovic, 2010),
lest we fall into the trap of Science without conscious-
ness is the ruin of the soul (Rabelais, 1964, p. 137).

The dilemma(s) we face are about the values that
we choose. Todays obvious lesson is that tech giants
not only watch us, but they then apply what we preach
in IS, ie, develop agile apps and digital platforms in
ways that sense and respond to our needs and create
business value (Sambamurthy, Bharadwaj, & Grover,
2003). Further, they learn more about us the more we
use their platforms in order to accumulate the highest
possible value. If we are becoming pawns fascinated by
technologies that are slowly enslaving us for the ben-
ets of a few, it might be too late for a new Jaccuse of
digital capitalism (Grimshaw, 2018) and of a surveil-
lance society (Zubo, 2015). Whatever the truth of
these statements, digital transformation is questioning
our values. Whatever our political preferences, our
responsibility as academics is to reect more about
the personal, collective, and societal risks associated
with digital transformation, and to call into question
the prevailing utilitarian or libertarian thinking to
invite new ways to exert
look at problems that

responsibilities when innovating (Stahl, 2012). Norms
and values are important (Mingers, 1980), and whereas
risks appear at all levels, the greatest diculties lie at
the collective and, in particular, at the societal level
where individuals cannot do much by themselves.

Liberty in the motto of the French Republic and the
rst Amendment of the Bill of Rights to the US
Constitution which protects free speech are exemplars
of how freedom is important to us, to society. But
these values are being questioned, perhaps even mod-
ied by our individual and collective relationship to
technology. On the one hand, freedom of expression
seems to be reinforced by microblogging, voting plat-
forms and online forums as well as email campaigns
which put local to global in a heartbeat (Shirky,
2008, p. 12); and where avatars enable us to express
certain thoughts and facets of our hidden personality
and of the life that we live in cyberspace (Schultze,
2014). Is this a sign of empowerment and emancipa-
tion (Benkler, 2006), or participatory exploitation, as
Marxist analysts would argue (Allmer et al., 2015), in
which behaviours and systems are strategically induced
by the Tech Giants and other powers to exploit indi-
viduals for nancial benet? On the other hand,
whereas the risks of being manipulated by fake news
are as old as philosophy (Goldstein, 2018), new risks
appear such as cyberstalking (Tow, Dell, & Venable,
2010) and phishing (Moody, Galetta, & Dunn, 2017).
What is certainly new is the scale and speed at which
these risks manifest themselves. Globalisation adds a
systemic element to these multiple and data-related
risks (Zubo, 2015). Even if these risks are major, we
can learn to protect ourselves and to manage them.
More importantly however, some threats are internal
to ourselves, in the sense that if we collectively do not
cultivate critical thinking and see the dangers ahead,
it wont be easy to protect ourselves. Whereas tools
can help us full our need for individuation, we
may become gradually and insidiously enslaved by
e-reputation systems or handheld personal tools that
atter our will to power (Nietzche, 1910). For any new
technology weve long known that we can observe
risks and benets and can become pessimistic or opti-
mistic because they exhibit good and dark sides
depending on use and context. We have learned that
many eects are emergent, in the sense that they are
not foreseeable, which runs against the promise of a
computer controlled society (Beniger, 1986), in the
sense that our actions are under control because they
can be programmed/planned, traced and checked by
computers. However, governments have not heard or
most probably do not want to hear this lesson. The
the no touch (contactless) society in
project of
Denmark shows that technological fascination and
vested interests are still dominant and that the project
of a control society is still alive, despite evidence such
total control and
as hacking demonstrating that

privacy
(Ngwenyama,
Henriksen, & Hardt, under review). If the unforesee-
able eects of technology limit the control that is
possible, then why do we need to worry? The short
answer is: (a) because by denition control unduly
limits our freedom and may exclude people and (b)
is not exercised transparently. But
because control
what if these unforeseeable eects are in fact related
to monitoring exerted by the very few who manipulate
the action dynamics (Zubo, 2015)? Even absent of
any instrumental action, what about exclusion eects 
of the elderly or the handicapped for example  of a
contactless society? Behind the trend of personalisation
of tools and systems (Baskerville, 2011) and the myriad
control and articial intelligence tools that we have
created,
freedom and
autonomy.

there is a debate about

Freedom to express ones views, to be informed, to
communicate, to possess, to travel is, in a word, freedom
to act. For philosophers of action, to act is to do some-
thing voluntarily (Juarrero, 2002). The IS literature has
long considered mandatory vs voluntary use of systems
(Brown, Massey, Montoya-Weiss, & Burkman, 2002)
without going far enough in terms of what this means,
except in rare exceptions such as those considering dis-
ciplined empowerment (Elmes, Strong, & Volko, 2005).
When things become programmed, willingness to
choose can become delegated to the machine or to agents
who may then act based on decision rules provided by
the machine without knowing how the decision was
made. Hence the debate on close vs open code (Lessig,
1999) also referred to as transparency of algorithms
(Kononenko, 2001). What will happen with the myriad
complex services that will be oered with the Internet of
Things (Oberlnder, Rglinger, Rosemann, & Kees,
2017)? Nietzche and Hegel have very profoundly
reected on the dangers of delegating tasks between
humans (Kain, 1996) that we can apply to our relation-
ships with machines. The slave through his work makes
his master dependent on him; and those who think they
are the master may, in reality, become the slave. Not only
are we naked without our IT prostheses, but we do not
control what they do in certain situations. Some would
say, Fine, we have to live with our age. But what if,
without knowledge or control and consent, machines
destroy others lives, others economies, or degrade our
natural environments? How do we conceptualise our
autonomy with respect to autonomous vehicles and
automated trading systems which, by denition, learn
and take decisions, which in turn can, if learning is
signicant, put us in unprecedented or unanticipated
dangerous social situations without our consent? Our
freedom is and has to be limited for moral reasons,
because our freedom should not be exerted at the
expense of others freedom. Hence Kants conceptualisa-
tion of autonomy as self-imposition of the moral law
(Kant, 1785/2011): A rational will must be regarded as

autonomous, or free, in the sense of being the author
of the law that binds it. The fundamental principle of
morality  the Categorical imperative  is none other
than the law of an autonomous will (Johnston, 2016).
This law contains two components: the independence of
ones deliberation and choice from manipulation by
others and the capacity to rule oneself (Dworkin, 1988).
Autonomy can be used to refer both to the global con-
dition (autonomous personhood) and to a more local
notion (Christman, 2015) such as autonomy when
equipped with a smartphone. How and to what extent
can we exert our autonomy? Are free will and constraints
on human behaviour arising from neuronal forces com-
patible (Ellis, Murphy, & OConnor, 2009; Mckenna &
Coates, 2015)?

If our freedom and actions become limited by
systems, so that we consider agency leaning towards
the technology side, technology acquires autonomy
(Markus & Rowe, in press). Does it mean human
autonomy is diminished? IT also enables new actions.
Humans may still have agency in systems which allow
agency to both humans and bots for separate tasks.
Usually we discuss autonomy as an issue for human
subjects. Now, what does it mean for technology to be
free? How can technology identify a moral law, if any;
or put dierently, can computers act as moral agents
(Stahl, 2004)? And if we reject technologys autonomy
how do we ascribe responsibility to humans or orga-
nisations and conceptualise governance in such an
automated world (Leclercq-Vandelannoitte & Bertin,
2018)? Regardless of the position we take on causality
and what legal dispositions prevail, these questions
depend on principles regarding what is action, inten-
tion, will, responsibility, autonomy  all concepts that
have been best delineated and discussed by moral
philosophy (or ethics), particularly since Kant and
by the philosophy of action (Juarrero, 2002), and
not much considered as yet by IS research except in
very specialised journals.

Thus, if digitalisation of society is questioning our
values such as freedom, we see that reasoning criti-
cally about these questions is inuenced by philoso-
phy. On issues like security (control) and privacy,
Lowry, Dinev, and Willison (2017) consider the
ethics of artefacts as a fundamental element for IS
research, albeit not always taken into account. In fact
I would claim that philosophy always inuence IS
work but the way in which it does this is seldom
for practical reasons
made explicit. I know that
related to length of papers and time constraints, we
neglect this. But by doing so we espouse a tradition,
which has implicit or explicit assumptions that we are
often not even aware of. We cannot escape philoso-
phising, even if most of the time, we as IS researchers,
do not build explicitly on philosophy. When we
dont, this blinds us, and it would be better to make
explicit on what (strand of) philosophy we are basing

(Hirschheim, Klein, & Lyytinen, 1995)? But let me
nish my story about how digitalisation of society is
questioning our values and why better critical reason-
ing invites philosophising.

for

What did equality mean for the rst article of the
Declaration of the Rights of the Man and the Citizen
the rst article of
in 1789,
the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 by the United
Nations, or for Kant in his Groundwork of the meta-
physics of morals? Whatever their dierences in terms
of natural talent, men share equal dignity. Social
distinctions can only be founded on common utility,
states the rst article of the Declaration. This also
meant, after the talents parable in Matthew 25
(1430) (Harrington, 1991), that the natural aristo-
cratic order was over. Dignity was to be gained by
work, by labour (Ferry, 2014) through autonomy and
creativity. Autonomy is needed, because we face
necessity (and again we cannot completely delegate
our share unless we enslave ourselves). Creativity is
needed, because through work, we participate in the
creation of the world that we inhabit. A caveat, how-
ever: creativity works for both good and evil as the
myth of Prometheus tells us. Work is normal because
our human condition is to work, even if it is hard and
resembles labour (St Paul): all men must gain their
dignity. In the Benedictine monasteries ora et labora
is the rule because to work is to avoid all sorts of
vices, especially laziness and hubris. In a society
where bots execute more and more tasks, how do
people, highly qualied or not, access work or keep
their job and therefore exert their equality in dignity?
For Marxist analysts, digital labour can be seen as
reproducing power structures and unequally distrib-
uted life chances (Allmer et al., 2015; Bergvall-
Kreborn & Howcroft, 2014), if not by reinforcing
them to the benet of the platform owners (Fuchs &
Sevignani, 2013). They distinguish, digital
labour
toil  a form oered by the logic of capitalism 
from playful digital work in line with the logic of
the commons (Fuchs & Sevignani, 2013). For philo-
sophers like Kant or Serres, technology is neutral. We
cannot just say that technology eliminates work; it is
society and institutions that shape such choices
(Kreps, 2018) and can make them good or evil, and
human beings more or less equals in dignity.

Many modern nations and regimes have advocated
praising liberty and equality while privileging one a
little more over the other, thus leading towards more
libertarian or more egalitarian societies (Stone, 2001).
Socialist regimes advocate the removal of inequalities

too-
individualistic society, if we forget Kants categorical
imperative, present in the Declaration of human and
citizen rights, individual liberty could cause harm to
others. While the ideas of liberty and equality were
part of the Enlightenment, another political philoso-
phy seems to have made its way over the last two
centuries: utilitarianism, which states that the proper
course of action is the one that maximises utility and
benets the majority. Utilitarianism, also called con-
sequentialism (Mingers & Walsham, 2010), can be
considered ethically weak because it is insensitive to
rights. However, as advocated by Bentham and Mills
in the nineteenth century, utilitarianism can be con-
sidered a fundamental instrument for justifying deci-
sions of a technological society, a society that believes
in technical progress. Such an approach, based as it is
on methodological individualism, can become dan-
gerous if the majority is blind to its potential dangers
or is manipulated by a few. To counter such perils,
including those of collective regimes that could go
too far on equality and those of liberal regimes that
could go too far on liberty, revolutionaries added a
third value to bind the rst two together: fraternity,
which includes both Philadelphia (brotherly love) and
Adelphotes (community of brothers).

For Arendt, human fallibility in the execution of a
contract is the price of freedom. The impossibility of
perfect control within a community of equals is the
consequence of plurality and reality. . . the joy of
inhabiting together a world whose reality is guaran-
teed for each by the presence of all [. . .] In contrast
Varians vision of a computer-mediated world strikes
me as an arid wasteland  not a community of equals
bound through law in the inevitable and ultimately
fruitful human struggle with uncertainty. (Zubo,
2015, p. 81)

Is digitalisation moving individuals and society towards
wider social identity? and fraternity? Let us consider
two brief examples: social media and interaction with
robots, whether mediated by experts or not. Some may
consider that any platform that allows people to com-
municate together is an important path towards recog-
nising each other and fraternity. On the other hand,
when we experience negative behaviours on social
media, we may view these platforms as being used
more in the pursuit of private interests and to monetise
our personal data, which runs counter to augmenting
trust and possible fraternity. A deeper philosophical
explanation interprets social media behaviours as either
instrumental communication at play, as described by
Habermas or Gomann, or as a Bourdieusian pursuit of
social, and possibly economic, capital (Qi, Monod,
Fang, & Deng, 2018). Alternatively, one can question
whether attitudes and behaviours on such platforms

384

EPILOGUE

reect a need to search for oneself, to which Sartres
philosophy is appropriate or Heideggers notions of
shared-world and being with others (Qi et al., 2018).
Levinass philosophy could also be explored as explain-
ing the diculties rather than the desire for social media
(Introna & Brigham, 2007). Going beyond the usual
psychological approaches to explain and discuss tech-
nological choices, philosophy can thus help interpret
the good and dark sides of behaviours at the societal
level, such as how and why we associate IT artefact with
certain values (eg, social media with fraternity) and
hence enable us to re-conceptualise the IT artefact
(Cheikh-Ammar, 2018).

Similarly, interactions with robots can aect our
feelings of fraternity. Robots can replace humans for
dicult or dangerous tasks, or cooperate with humans;
this is the promise of the interesting concept of cobo-
tics. Bots can be also useful as agents when humans
cannot be present. However, fraternity is not enhanced
when people interact with machines. And we experi-
ence social isolation when relating with machines takes
up most of our time (Kreps, 2018). On the contrary, our
humanity and fraternity are enhanced when we have in-
depth relationships with other humans, when we spend
time with them, when we show signs of caring and
compassion. Social recognition is a precondition for
human relationships and fraternity. Social recognition
cannot be imparted to robots or voice servers, despite
the extensive progress made by articial intelligence for
personal identication. Hence, the human preference
for face-to-face interactions, even when there are no
cognition problems with user-friendly machines
(Rowe & Limayem, 1999). This is why organisations
using articial intelligence have understood that it is
preferable that messages continue to be presented by
employees to customers. The selection process, the
denition of targets that can be attracted by mass cus-
tomisation oerings,
is assigned to bots, but it is
humans who make contact so that customers perceive
the targeting process as not so mechanistic.

Returning once again to the notion of fraternity:
machines currently have no capacity to compute
meaning, because meaning is not strictly the applica-
tion of rules to transform some symbols into other
symbols (Searle, 1980). It is about understanding
what one is doing (Obermeier, 1983). There is no
human-machine communication of meanings in a
conversation of humans with machines. The general
problem of supplying thoughts to Articial Agents,
can only be addressed when, rst,
the Symbol
Grounding Problem is solved, thereby giving con-
cepts
to the manipulated symbols, and second,
when articial consciousness is achieved, thereby giv-
ing intentionality to those manipulated symbols
(Rodriguez, Hermosillo, & Lara, 2012). Articial
intelligence techniques use voice and image recogni-
tion, but they do not identify a person per se. Plato

asked: how do we identify each other as a person, as
humans? And he answered that it was not by sense
impression (Whitaker, 1996), but by recognising our
Being or Oneness with the other (McDowell, 1973).
When articial intelligence diagnoses a dicult case
or situation, to what extent will the human justify a
the human appears only as machine
decision if
appendage? Indeed, we may still assume that the
human will have to do the work, at least in certain
critical situations to which we are particularly sensi-
tive. Even if Watson proves much more reliable and
eective in identifying tumours and cancers than
radiologists, will the radiologists just endorse the
machine diagnosis without independently checking
to conrm it? In other words, while the costs of
reliable predictions based on articial
intelligence
drop, the need for advanced human judgment skills
sensitive bad news
may grow, especially about
(Agrawal, Gans, & Goldfarb, 2018). What we have
learnt about more classical decision support systems
(Rowe, 2006) still holds, except that here we are
talking about human life. In fact, many patients
may well not accept the machines diagnosis without
the assessment and conrmation of
their doctor
(Farajallah, Le Go-Pronost, Penard, & Suire, 2015).
If doctors conrm that their ex post-diagnosis agrees
with Watsons, why and how would they invest in
such aid? And if the two diagnoses are contradictory,
doctors may be put in a very dicult position. Such
situations are complex and show that even though
deep learning has made great advances, there is still a
long way before a machine can completely replace
health professionals and patients or doctors will com-
pletely trust a machine.

So far we have discussed how IT might inuence the
values on which the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights was founded in 1948. IT is also supporting evol-
ving values such as control or security as noticed above as
well as collaboration and non-possession with the rise of
the sharing economy (Belk, 1988). Whether the latter is
reinforcing fraternity among humans or indicates a
growing concern for sustainability or simple economic
rationality is an interesting avenue for IS research.
More radical advances in IT and biotechnologies might
have a more disruptive eect on our values. The trans-
humanist dream to extend life by a hundred years by
replacing entire human organs as they age can be inter-
preted as adding eternity to Enlightenment values. It can
also be seen as playing God, like Prometheus who was
punished for his theft of re, but also for having stolen
Athenas powers to create the arts and all sorts of articial
artefacts. As described in the Book of Genesis, this is the
capital sin, the hubris of wanting to play God or to
become Homo Deus (Harari, 2015). Just as importantly,
this would lead to society, as in Greek cosmology, of
eternals (gods) and mortals  indeed, a mortal breach
in the notion of fraternity and equality.

Even if all these technologies, including articial
intelligence, are a long way from the point at which
the above statements could be anywhere close to
some reality, the minimum we owe our students
and children is to say that caution and philosophical
thinking are in order! We wont be credible if we say
we could not know, even if in truth we do not now
know. What is clear is that most of the questions I
have too quickly raised in this section are complex
and far beyond the simple constructs that we use in
our usual IS research papers. We must return to
philosophy to engage with the complexity of the
world we live in to conceptualise issues and what
they can mean for dierent stakeholders.

3. Bringing metaphysics back to engage with
axiology

As argued by the guest editors, serious questions
require serious examination of even harder questions.
While the IS discipline has made major eorts and
contributed in the domain of epistemology and meth-
odology, I would argue that we still need to do much
more on the three other domains of philosophy pre-
sented by the guest editors: metaphysics, rationality,
and axiology. While there has been some work on
ethics, Nik Hassan, John Mingers and Bernd Stahl
underscore that IS research needs to be engaged with
the many risks related to digital transformation. This
takes us into the realm of values. Axiology is a vast
domain, but to treat its issues seriously we need a
strong intellectual basis in metaphysics (Hassan et al.,
2018; Kreps, 2018). And to begin with, who are we
to have values? What is a human being? Philosophy
of Mind is important because it addresses the ques-
tions of consciousness,
language, and reason. For
Aristotle and Descartes body and mind/soul were
distinct. While Kant kept this distinction, for some
revolutionaries of the Enlightenment, Soul is a vain
notion (La Mettrie, 1753). Being a machine, know-
ing how to distinguish good from evil, being born
with intelligence and a reliable instinct of moral, and
being an animal are things that are not more contra-
dictory than being a monkey or a parrot and giving
oneself pleasure (p. 34), Mettrie believed. Man is a
machine. . . a substance (p. 37), he proposed, and
this view is mirrored in some eliminative material-
ist philosophies of the twentieth century such as
especially
those
Churchland, for whom consciousness is mere electro-
eervescent delusion. Such behaviourist and materi-
alist goals of reducing the mental to the physical, of
course, tend to result in absurdity, damaging both
our idea of what the mind is and what the physical
universe constitutes. Such views are countered by a
range of other philosophers and positions, including
for whom our

and how we

subjectivity is undeniably real,
for whom human
awareness and experience are more than a mere
pack of neurons (Libet, 2005, p. 5), and for whom
some more dualist or idealist position must be found.
Discussing such ontological questions is critical for
IS research, but we should also explore other forms of
realism than critical realism, such as embodied rea-
lism and speculative realism, as well as diverse types
of idealism. Embodied realism oers potential for
cognition, the design of human-computer interfaces,
neuro IS and modelling, among other domains where
there is direct application in IS, because it explains
why we use metaphors
reason
causally (Lako & Johnson, 1999; Markus & Rowe,
in press). In fact, embodied realism can be considered
as a revolution regarding many entrenched beliefs in
philosophical systems based on recent discoveries of
cognitive sciences, such as the inherently embodied
mind (against Cartesian and Kantian dualism), the
mostly unconscious mind and reasoning, and the
metaphorical character of abstract concepts. As a
consequence of this embodiment, the mind cannot
be known simply by self-reection. This justies
empirical research, but also has consequences for
morality
realism
(Harman, 2010; Meillassoux, 2010), which builds on
Latour, who himself builds on Whitehead, is promis-
ing for those who question sociomaterial interactions.
Whiteheads process-relational cosmology (ontology)
(Whitehead, 1929) builds on Bergsons notion of time
and is an important intellectual source for at
ontologies, applicable to worlds where processes
involve
and emerging wholes
(Markus & Rowe, in press) not dierent in ontologi-
cal status (De Landa, 2002), and for thinking about
inuential thinkers for IS research like Latour (Kreps,
2018). In his polemic Against Nature, Kreps (2018)
brilliantly demonstrates how strongly IS research has
been and still is inuenced by a positivist view of the
world, which insists on methodological individual-
ism, and which screens out the reality of subjective
consciousness, pretends that the rational agent user
is an apolitical and atheoretical depiction of
the
human condition, rather than a specic tool of neo-
classical economic theory and neoliberal politics
(p. 97), and negates the myriad relationships that
exist in a world that is becoming. Instead, Kreps
to borrow from Bergsons and
(2018) proposes
Whiteheads process-relational philosophy,
from
moral philosophy and from complexity theory, to
claim that the libertarian argument for the neoliberal
digital capitalist society runs counter to the reality of
the natural world of which we are a part.

interacting parts

Journal articles cannot do justice to such rich trans-
disciplinary work, but it is important to note here, that
in the eyes of Bergson and Whitehead, all matter and
subjectivity are interrelated in an ongoing processual

ow and that interpretivism is closer to reality than
positivism. From an axiological perspective, much
must be held in common (Kreps, 2018, p. 82).
Blondel was born in 1861 like Whitehead and died 2
years after him in 1949. They did not know each other,
but they both constructed a cosmology which strives
to answer the question of how freedom of the indivi-
dual is compatible with the idea that each person is
related through numerous linkages to all other beings
and, even, to the entire universe. Put otherwise, how
can we understand that the greater the density of the
network that relates this real entity to the universe, the
more its individuation is complete? The universe is
one continuous energy soup where dierences are
only distinguishable by density and perspective of the
viewer. We are constantly exchanging energy with
the Sun, the Earth, all the galaxies and black holes in
a time-space continuum. Such views relate science,
metaphysics and theology. In particular, Whiteheads
cosmology has far-reaching consequences which chal-
lenge our notion of a stable relationship between
object and attribute, what in design science research
we also model as ontologies and implement in rela-
tional databases (Giacomoni & Sardas, 2014). Based on
the scientic knowledge of the twentieth century the
embodied realism of Lako and Johnson and the
cosmologies of Blondel and Whitehead oer very dif-
ferent ontologies of the world which challenge ethical
knowledge and responsibilities.

4. Philosophising because theory
development requires metatheories and
intuition

These glimpses of how philosophy can help IS
research face our societal challenges through axiology
and metaphysics also have consequences for episte-
mology and rationality. We certainly need philosophy
because we rst need to ground the knowledge we
produce in epistemology, a branch of philosophy
which discusses the validity conditions of the produc-
tion of scientic knowledge (Lee, 2004).

First, axiology is invited in epistemology when we
use a critical theoretical methodology and take a value
position to challenge the status quo as recommended
by Myers and Klein (2011) as one of the six principles
for conducting critical social research. Critical research
is a quest against injustice and undue limitations of
freedom, which calls for a methodology dierent from
an interpretive methodology that interprets values but
does not challenge the status quo (Cecez-Cekmanovic,
2010; Rowe, 2009). The Critical social sciences [. . .]
require normative theoretical foundations and a dif-
ferent research methodology to deal with moral and
normative-ethical questions to pursue emancipatory
interests (Cecez-Cekmanovic, 2010, p. 4). This is
necessary for both individual emancipation and for

societal
issues
improvement. These methodological
are addressed with very dierent arguments by a neo-
humanist strand, largely based on Habermas, which
focuses on denaturalising restrictive forms of
IS
development and use, and by a post-humanist
strand largely based on Foucault, who questions the
humanist assumption of the unied autonomous sub-
ject (Cecez-Cekmanovic, 2010). To Myers and Kleins
six principles, Cecez-Kecmanovic proposes adding the
overarching principle of reexivity and dialectical
reasoning which falls
type of
rationality.

into a dierent

Second, metaphysics, such as those proposed by
Bergson, Blondel and Whitehead as well as speculative
realism by Harman, Meillassoux and others, invites us
to reconsider positively the role of intellectual think-
ing, metatheories, intuition and theoretical reasoning
in the face of what can be perceived as the imperialism
of methodological reason (Aronowitz & Ausch, 2000).
Such reason is rooted in Kant and modern science,
which have retained the knowing subject/object of
knowledge distance, also known as Cartesian dualism.
This culminated with the Vienna circle of logical
empiricists whose primary claim was
to abolish
metatheory, that is, to deny any proposition that
failed the tests of observation and experiment
(Aronowitz & Ausch, 2000, p. 701).
Indeed, by
requiring that all scientic investigation be subject
to falsication, positivism restricted scientic inquiry
to objects whose propositions and observational state-
ments can be operationalised in methodological terms.
[. . .] Thinking a world beyond-the-given became rele-
gated to non-Anglo-American philosophy. (idem,
p. 702). Retroductive process in Critical realism is an
eort to infer a causal mechanism to explain the given
empirical phenomenon and thus develops a theorising
that goes beyond (Williams & Wynn, 2018). However,
unlike Bhaskar, the way critical realism is mainly
applied in social sciences, management, and IS has a
strong empirical focus, and is not oriented towards a
metatheoretical construction and a new philosophy for
what Langefors (1980) called our infological world. A
philosophical discussion based on critical realism
would be to discuss intransitive structures (Mingers,
2014). Another way to go beyond the given is by
developing justied (!) models of possible future
worlds (Frank, 2006; Rorty, 1999) that serve those
who live the future as an inspiration, and a meaningful
orientation. The respective constructions cannot be
invalidated by confronting them with empirical data,
because they are purposefully dierent from reality.
(Olbrich, Frank, Gregor, Niederman, & Rowe, 2017).
Aronowitz and Ausch follow Feyerabends (1998)
and Kuhns critique of Popper in arguing against posi-
tivist methodologies. They rst consider solutions that
other social scientists have brought to the subject-
object dualism. They present two main approaches of

hermeneutic and phenomenology, both of which have
been adopted in IS research. While introducing a
principle of interaction between researchers and actors
(eg, Klein & Myers, 1999), Aronowitz and Ausch con-
tend that hermeneutic approaches in social sciences
are also dominated by method. This is not the case
with Alford (1998). He puts on par evidence and
theory and shows that there is always a choice in
terms of
theorising between putting emphasis on
explaining what happened, emphasising the meanings
and tracing historically the events, but that all three
aspects should be involved, as demonstrated using
masterpieces of the founding fathers of sociology:
Durkheim, Marx, and Weber. For Alford the task of
the researcher is to choose which one of the three will
be in the foreground while including the other two in
the background. In a given inquiry, these three aspects
of theoretical development are necessary, but not of
equal importance depending on theoretical choice.

that

tradition is

With phenomenology, the critique of positivism is
more radical because it not only rejects dualism, it
advocates a knowing that is inherently individually
subjective. Social objects are always
interpreted,
and these interpretations are always mediated by
metatheories which are generally ignored and
must be revealed. However, Aronowitz and Ausch
the risk posed by
(2000, p. 712) recognise that
theory
the phenomenological
development becomes so important that it loses the
concrete historicity of the object to be studied. In
their essay (Aronowitz & Ausch, 2000) opt, along
with Feyerabend and a rich philosophical tradition,
for a position where social knowledge can be derived
without method. They propose an onto-historical
paradigm based on a dierent understanding of
objectivity: A historically situated and oscillating
Being is the case, not the divided subject/object
(p. 713).
Inspired by Sartre, Spinoza, Deleuze,
Adorno and many others, they claim that engage-
ment with the complex and mostly messy world and
its history and [of] the body with its intuitive tenta-
cles, constitute an adequate basis for knowledge
(p. 717). By a single stroke [science] claimed to
sweep away the tradition of a hundred thousand
years, which had become one with human nature
itself. It wrote an end to the ancient animist covenant
between man and nature, leaving nothing in place of
that precious bond but an anxious quest in a frozen
universe of solitude. [. . .] [Science] has however com-
mended recognition, but

perceive something, to be aware of an object, as
phenomenology argues. While Blondel wants
to
ground his philosophy on science, he criticises the
incapacity of science to seize the unity of Being in
evolution. As claimed by Aristotle, we can also
acquire knowledge by intuition.
Intuition stems
from what we experience and theorise and is beyond
the analytical processes of science (Klein & Rowe,
2008; Schwartz, 2011), such as dierentiation or frac-
talisation (as described by Kuhn (Tarafdar &
Davison, in press)).

Ultimately, this is why, although counter to the
dominant paradigm, theory development and metathe-
ories are needed. To advance research requires adding
value on at least one of the two levels, theoretical
or empirical. I would argue that in IS, because we
are strong in methods and confront phenomena
where empirical richness seems to expand like the uni-
verse, we too often neglect to develop our theoretical
reasoning and conceptual reasoning based on intuition
(Stahl, 2014). Hence, the need for pure theory develop-
ment papers in our preferred set of genres of papers
(Teeni, Rowe, gerfalk, & Lee, 2015)!

5. Critique is in our mission, and society
expects it for deliberating about action

Being critical is part of the mission of all scholars,
and explicitly of those of us who publish in EJIS. This
is not just an issue for research and theoretical rea-
soning, which deals with epistemology and concerns
all scientists, but of practical reasoning that would
benet both our students and society when question-
ing how agents deliberate about action (Wallace,
2014). Reecting about practical reasoning in specic
circumstances of everyday life, at work or in private
life, falls in the domain of the philosophy of action.
Unlike theoretical reason,

Practical reason, by contrast, is concerned not with
the truth of propositions but with the desirability or
value of actions. [. . .] Practical reason takes a dis-
tinctively normative question as its starting point. It
typically asks, of a set of alternatives for action none
of which has yet been performed, what one ought to
do, or what it would be best to do. [. . .] The contrast
between practical and theoretical reason is essentially
a contrast between two dierent systems of norms:
those for the regulation of action on the one hand,
and those for the regulation of belief on the other.
[. . .] Theoretical reasoning leads to modications of
our beliefs, whereas practical reasoning leads to
modications of our
(Bratman 1987;
Harman, 1986). (Wallace, 2014)

intentions

Like Aronowitz and Ausch, we do not claim that we
should stop publishing non-critical papers. This
would be unrealistic, but also foolish, because the
reviewing process brings a critique, and such papers,
when published in good journals can be considered as

inscribe themselves in some critical thinking. My
frustration with non-critical research is related to
the often limited contributions these approaches
oer in practice, both in terms of theorising (as
demonstrated in the case of positivist research by
Grover and Lyytinen (2015) and in terms of their
practical implications. Hence, my desire for EJIS to
publish a greater proportion of critical papers.
However, I want to emphasise that I do not consider
that non-critical papers cannot make important con-
tributions if they introduce or relax specic con-
straints in their underlying assumptions. In other
words, one can be positivist and critically useful, or
interpretivist and critically useful without espousing
or developing a critical social theory. To begin with
the last combination, any good interpretivist study is
a potential foundation for a critical one taking a value
stance. How can one be both critical and positivist?
For instance, an in-depth utilitarian approach would
be critical and distinguished from mere consequenti-
alism, if it considers the risks and benets for each
type of heterogeneous stakeholders rather than con-
sidering only the eectiveness of proposed solutions
for the majority. This would also suppose that the
hidden costs and risks be revealed to the stakeholders.
In many cases if users knew about the current impli-
cations of their use they might prefer discontinue
using the service and their expressed utility would
change. This would contribute to emancipating we
humans from false consciousness, collective delu-
sions and oppressive ideologies that we have created
(Habermas, 1984). Current revelations on digitalisa-
tion of society suggest that we have a false conscious-
ness, collective delusion, or at least an uncritical
ideological embrace of it (Rosen, 1996).

We also need to develop the critical practical rea-
soning of our students, which will also benet our
stakeholders. With greater professionalisation of
Bachelors and Masters programmes, higher education
has emphasised IS/IT operational knowledge for
higher employability. In a eld where knowledge and
know-how are constantly renewed, this professionali-
sation trend has reached its main goal: students being
quickly recruited. But this has sometimes come at the
expense of critical thinking development which may
be lacking. And that is precisely what recruiters con-
sider
students are missing the most
(Kappelman, Johnson, Torres, Maurer, & Mclean,
under review). There are certainly many ways to
develop critical thinking, but remaining open to dif-
ferent paths oers the best safeguard against research
programmes dead-ends. Learning from our own errors
as well as from others in organisations and society can
be very protable and is at the basis of the teaching
case study method. Accompanied with a base of cri-
tical thinking related to current and past societal

that our

problems, forms of critical practical reasoning can be
developed for decision-making related to investments
and IS development and use (Hirschheim et al., 1995;
Ngwenyama & Klein, in press).

6. How to engage with philosophy (when one
has not been trained in philosophy)?

If youre going to reopen basic philosophical issues,
heres the minimum you have to do. First, you need
a method of investigation. Second, you have to use
that method to understand basic philosophical con-
cepts. Third, you have to apply that method to pre-
vious philosophies to understand what
they are
about and what makes them hang together. And
fourth, you have to use that method to ask the big
questions: What it is to be a person? What is mor-
ality? How do we understand the causal structure of
the universe?. (Lako & Johnson, 1999, p. 8)

Consistently with my caution about the best method
(dont get me wrong, I am not against method; other-
wise, I would not be an academic; but Im against its
supremacy or dogmatic use!) I am not arguing for a
given methodology for philosophising. Philosophising
requires reexivity and freedom. Leibniz recognised
that we should distinguish between the issue of
method of inquiry (how to discover) and method of
exposition or writing (how to expose what we have
learned) which can be typical of a philosophical genre
(Loekmer, 1966). Rather,
I prefer a diversity of
approaches for both and would avoid any strong nor-
mative recommendation of what should be done.
Moreover, because of limited space, let me oer just
a few thoughts.

What can I know and how to investigate it? To
engage with philosophy is to be open and is a matter
of state of mind. The method of enquiry depends on
ones research goal. If you are ready for a long jour-
ney identify the best philosophical system and adjust
it for IS research! Some may prefer to begin studying
a philosophical system which, in the idealist tradition,
generalises a great idea (eg, Kants transcendental
idealism which allows to distinguish dierent episte-
mic trends in IS (Monod, 2003)) or oer an approach
that can be systematically applied to information
system (eg, Pierces triadic sign (Beynon-Davies,
2018), whereas others with a more practical inclina-
tion will look at how philosophy can inform their
problem at hand. They would,  la Aristotle, distin-
guish and relate their problem and issues with what
dierent philosophers may have said about them. It
is with this practical inclination that Lynne Markus
and I worked on our study of causality. Without
espousing any philosophical system, what we took
from analytical philosophy was an ability to interro-
gate our language, whose most radical position is
exemplied by the late Wittgenstein, who considered
that philosophy had nothing else to say, but could

help interrogate our language and logic, ie, our rea-
soning. Philosophy strives to generalise and by this
eort explore the powerfulness of a coherent system
of thought. Whether it is applied to all entities (as in
metaphysics) or only to the issue of language and
scientic language in particular (analytic philosophy)
is what divides continental philosophy from analyti-
cal philosophy.

How can one expose the ndings of ones philoso-
phical investigations? When we in the western world
assert that the Greeks invented philosophy, we in fact
recognise that they developed a method for exposing
and at the same time probing their knowledge. As
mentioned by the guest editors of this Special Issue,
philosophy and science were the same thing, but we
can argue that other civilisation (eg, Egyptian) has
already developed scientic knowledge. What
the
Greek invented was the critical discourse which devel-
ops through dialogue and argumentation (Howland,
argumentation
1992; Nightingale, 2000). Critical
through
self-
exploration about what we know and do has been an
essential part of philosophy throughout Renaissance
(eg, De Montaigne, 1580/2003). Engaging in dialogue
about problems claries discourse, avoids dead-ends
and opens up new perspectives. It is the traditional
method and the Greek heritage for exposing ones
ideas in philosophy which was still used throughout
enlightenment (eg, Diderot, 1785/1999) until today
(Deleuze & Parnet, 1987). This why alternatives genres
(Avital, Mathiassen, & Schultze, 2017), such as polemic
(Walsham, 2010) and theatre (Boland & Lyytinen,
2017) can play an important role for IS research.

open-mindedness,

erudition,

and

Alternatively following Descartes, several philoso-
phical systems have been exposed after the axiomatic
or deductive method. They look for the primary idea,
the idea from which all others derive. The archetypal
exemplar is Spinozas Ethics (not to be confused with a
discourse on morality) in which he uses this Cartesian
method with axioms, theorems, and corollaries to
deduct the essence of all things. This approach was
followed by Fichte, Hegel and Schelling. Malebranche
or Leibniz Theodicies also oer good instantiations of
this analytical method. Game theory can be viewed as a
this method for collective
modern descendent of
choices related to utilitarianism (Burgess, 2005). It has
been applied for modelling specic information system
problems (eg, Galbreth & Shor, 2010). However, cali-
bration and ndings should be discussed in light of
underlying philosophical assumptions of the model
and claims of superiority (such as rule utilitarianism
over act utilitarianism (eg, Burgess, 2005) toned down.
Whether for inquiry or exposition, the method of
philosophising is critical discourse in which members of
the community discuss particulars of challenging exis-
tential issues and hammer out reasoned positions about
them that cannot necessarily be codied in episteme (cf.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

389

Aristotle, 1934; Habermas, 1973; Toulmin, 2009). In
spirit true philosophising never claims to arrive at a
denitive answer (eg, on how to combine causality
positions on various dimensions (Markus & Rowe, in
press), as philosophers of science, notably Kuhn and
Popper, have convincingly argued. This holds even
more true for phenomena we study in IS which involves
studying social phenomena or designing tools for social
actors and belongs to social sciences. While in IS
research there is room for replication and negation
studies following a neo-positivist epistemology, one
could regard replication more broadly in a dierent
epistemological perspective as an integral part of an
ongoing critical discourse. In that sense, replication
would mean starting a discourse on a previous study,
story, scenario, artefact, method etc. and then trying to
validate it by reconstructing its epistemological out-
come (Olbrich et al., 2017). In a way this is the assump-
tion on which Design Science Research is based  the
idea that a designed artefact will replicate its eects
under certain conditions. However, this solution repli-
cation is always questionable in absence of a solid
theoretical framework. This critical argument  in the
narrow sense of epistemic critique  partakes in the
current debate on Design Science Research and its
genres (Peers, Tuunanen, & Niehaves, 2018). It should
nevertheless be furthered beyond a quarrel about the
best methodology and be discussed at the ethical and
metaphysical levels as well to reect a broader critical
discourse (eg, Klein, 1981; Mingers & Walsham, 2010;
Ulrich, 2003), ie, what philosophising is about.

7. Conclusion

Philosophy is the mother of all disciplines (cf. Hassan
et al., 2018). Today it can help IS research nurture itself
and face its most critical challenges related to digital
transformation and beyond. It is intimately tied to our
critical thinking because it proposes dierent thinking
systems, dierent paradigms or worldviews and not just
the three or four usual suspects, such as post-positivism,
critical realism, radical (also called pragmatic) construc-
tivism, interpretivism, we generally encounter in epis-
temology discourses (eg, Avenier & Thomas, 2015).
Any issue or solution can be examined from an onto-
logical (metaphysical), axiological or epistemological
viewpoint,
if not simply from a logical viewpoint,
because we encounter issues with language when we
engage in such knowledge work. Philosophy also pro-
vides a kind of grounding of ideas with insightful syn-
thetic arguments around which several disciplines can
build and confront their own perspectives when they
address complex issues. It enables us to go beyond
specialised traditions for attending to these systemic
Jean-Louis Le Moignes philosopy;
challenges (eg,
Eriksson, 1997). The relative lack of truly interdisciplin-
ary papers in our general IS journals  our so called AIS

390

EPILOGUE

basket of 8  might be partly related to the eorts such
projects require, but also to the fact that philosophy is
rarely invited in such interdisciplinary eorts (Tarafdar
& Davison, in press). IS researchers should view engage-
ment with philosophy as an opportunity. As compared
to other disciplines studying digitalisation, we actually
know a bit and care about technology. This suggests two
things, that (a) we can develop a deeper understanding
and (b) we can actually change the current state of
aairs by designing new IT and digital practices if we
recognise the limitations of our research, risks of what
we propose, and are explicit about our philosophical
assumptions.

Unfortunately, philosophy is a discipline in which
many IS and non-IS researchers are no longer educated
(Stocker, 2018). Management disciplines have elimi-
nated this source, except perhaps philosophy of science.
Returning to this source and reclaiming it would help
us face todays challenges and if we truly interrogate the
limitations of our knowledge. Philosophy is key to
developing the capacity to be critical  a soft skill, the
lack of which worries the recruiters of our students 
because it entails reexivity and helps us to remain
open in the conversation (Gadamer, 1975; Toulmin,
2009). If stakeholders or researchers also look for
emancipation in organisations or society, philosophy
of action and moral philosophy may seem inevitable.
I do not take such a dogmatic stance as I have shown
above while expressing a desire for more critical theory
papers. Any paper built upon a thorough critique,
following the denition proposed at the outset of this
paper, which bears fruit is philosophising and welcome.
We have moved into abstraction (Ciborra, 1998;
Feyerabend, 1999), but we are missing many opportu-
nities to interrogate the richness of the problem space
that digital transformation has created for us. Schutz
and Luckmann (1973) argue for the expansion of
inquiry into aspects of our everyday life (as the pre-
eminent reality) such as the meaning-strata that turns
our material objects (our artefacts) into cultural objects
and infuses our ideas and set the limits of our recipro-
cal action as well as our self-understanding. Many
questions have not been treated because of our neglect
of philosophy. In the last century Heidegger warned in
the Question Concerning Technology (1954):

Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to tech-
nology, whether we passionately arm or deny it.
But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible
way when we regard it as something neutral. [. . .]
Everything depends on our manipulating technology
in the proper manner as a means. We will, as we say,
get technology spiritually in hand. We will master
it. The will to mastery becomes all the more urgent
the more technology threatens to slip from human
control. (Heidegger, 1954, pp. 45)

In order for the IS eld to escape the blinkers that might
be placed on it and in order to produce knowledge that

socially relevant and inuential, our
is original,
researchers need to conceive and explore alternatives
to current ways of thinking. Philosophy oers guidance
along that path (Hassan, 2014). All the reasons for being
critical, whether we like them or not, point to the
necessity of philosophy.

This special issue is not the rst important collective
eort on philosophy by IS researchers which goes
beyond epistemology (eg. Mingers & Willcocks, 2004;
Hirschheim et al. 2011), but I hope that this issue will
help show how interesting and enriching philosophis-
ing can be for IS research. I want to express our most
heartfelt thanks to Bernd, John and Nik, and to all the
authors and reviewers who made this special issue
possible. They demonstrate that philosophising in IS
research is doable, enjoyable, rewarding and that it has
made considerable progress with the support of its
the Association of
Special
Information Systems and as a regular track at ICIS! I
invite the reader to enjoy their introduction to philo-
sophy and its origins, as well as their mapping of
philosophy in four dimensions. Chapeau!

Title: A qualitative study examining the exclusive use of, PDF: Research_papers_50\biology paper.pdf
Header: ABSTRACT 
This qualitative study explores the experiences of six  students enrolled in a special topics biology 
class  that  exclusively  used  primary  literature  as  course  material.  Nature  of  science  (NOS) 
conceptions have been linked to students' attitudes toward scientific subjects, but there has been 
little  research  specifically  exploring the effects of  primary  literature use  on  NOS  conceptions.  To 
explore these effects, we used both written responses to an established and validated NOS survey 
taken at the beginning and end of the course and reflective essays in which students described in 
detail their experiences with using primary literature. The results indicate positive gains in various 
aspects of NOS conceptions as well as increased confidence with approaching original research. We 
conclude  by  suggesting  that  future  research  should  focus  on  how  primary  literature  use  affects 
nature  of  science  conceptions. We  also  suggest the expanded  use of  primary  literature  in  biology 
education

subjected to further scrutiny, perhaps further validated, built upon, critiqued, or 
replicated  by  other  researchers.  Primary  research  may  also  inform  policy,  or 
inspire  new  research  questions  or  technologies.  Research  shared  in  vetted 
publications may be viewed as the building blocks for our overall understanding 
of phenomena.  

Primary  literature  has  been  used  by  science  instructors  in  a  variety  of 
ways,  often  to  achieve  specific  educational  goals  (Muench,  2000).  Some 
instructors have used primary literature journal clubs as a sort of gateway to 
writing  reviews  and  writing  up  laboratory  exercises  in  the  style  of  scientific 
articles (DebBurman, 2002) or to build skills in understanding, interpreting, and 
presenting  data  (Glazer,  2000).  Others  use  primary  literature  to  demonstrate 
paradigm  shifts  in  science  as  a  nature  of  science  component  to  their  course 
(Hoskins,  2008),  to  demonstrate  how  research  progresses  in  the  real  world  by 
focusing  on  works  from  a  particular  laboratory  (Hoskins,  Stevens,  &  Nehm, 
2007), or to promote active and cooperative learning (Kitazono, 2010). Brill and 
colleagues suggest journal clubs be used by teachers to stay abreast of advances 
in science (Brill, Falk, & Yarden, 2003). Whole curricula may even be designed 
around  primary  literature  (Yarden,  Brill,  &  Falk,  2001).  It  is  clear  that 
educators  have  many  different  goals  in  mind  when  electing  to  use  primary 
literature in the classroom, but what has the research shown about outcomes for 
students? 

One of the major desired outcomes of using primary literature is boosting 
science literacy in students (DebBurman, 2002; Glazer, 2000; Hoskins, Lopatto, 
&  Stevens,  2011;  Hoskins  et  al.,  2007;  Kozeracki,  Carey,  Colicelli,  &  Levis-
Fitzgerald,  2006;  Muench,  2000;  Yarden  et  al.,  2001).  In  some  cases,  this 
outcome  was  even  achieved  (Glazer,  2000;  Kozeracki  et  al.,  2006).  Increased 
critical thinking skills are also a frequently-cited outcome (Hoskins et al., 2011, 
2007; Kozeracki et al., 2006; Muench, 2000; Sato et al., 2014). Improved research 
and  data  analysis  skills  have  also  been  reported  (DebBurman,  2002;  Glazer, 
2000; Hoskins et al., 2011; Round & Campbell, 2013). Confidence in approaching 
and  understanding  scientific  literature  is  also  a  reported  outcome  of  primary 
literature  use  (Glazer,  2000;  Hoskins  et  al.,  2011;  Murray,  2014;  Round  & 
Campbell,  2013;  Sato  et  al.,  2014).  Research  has  also  shown  that  students' 
epistemological  understandings  and  their  conceptions  of  science  as  a  human 
endeavor  can  be  improved  through  exposure  to  primary  science  literature 
(Hoskins  et  al.,  2011).  One  study  even  found  evidence  that  teaching  using 
primary  literature  helped  facilitate  students'  transition  to  doctoral  programs 
(Kozeracki  et  al.,  2006).  Certainly,  there  are  excellent  potential  benefits  to 
students from using primary literature.  

Hence, we used primary literature as our sole source of content material in 
a  special  topics  biology  course,  and  during  this  process,  we  sought  to  better 
understand  what  effects  the  use  of  primary  literature  might  have  on  the 
students.  Because  some  of  the  readings  focused  on  shifting  understandings  of 
phenomena (Heil et al., 2009; Janzen, 1973), research programs by a particular 
lab 
researcher 
(http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/bostwick_01),  and  also 
looked  broadly  at  science  and  society  by  covering  the  targeting  of  some 
evolutionary  biology  research  that  had  been  branded  as  frivolous  government 
spending  by  certain  political  pundits  (Brennan,  2013),  we  hypothesised  that 

or

students' nature of science views will improve as has been observed by Hoskins 
(2008). Postsecondary NOS instruction is discussed in great depth by Dushl and 
Grandy  (2012).  Notably,  explicit  reflective  NOS  instruction  has  been  deemed 
necessary  but  not  sufficient  alone  for  improving  NOS  views  (Khishfe  and  Abd-
El-Khalick,  2002).  Additionally,  as  previous  research  around  instruction  using 
primary literature has shown increases in content knowledge in specific areas of 
biology  (DebBurman,  2002;  Glazer,  2000;  Hoskins,  Lopatto,  &  Stevens,  2011; 
Hoskins  et  al.,  2007;  Kozeracki,  Carey,  Colicelli,  &  Levis-Fitzgerald,  2006; 
Kozeracki  et  al.,  2006;  Muench,  2000;  Yarden  et  al.,  2001),  we  wondered  if 
perhaps students' overall  biological content knowledge might improve based on 
the  variety  of  topics  covered  during  the  course  and  the  breadth  of  individual 
research done by the students in selecting and exploring presentation topics for 
the course.

Header: Methods 
Since  little  previous  research  has  focused  on  how  the  use  of  primary 
literature in courses on ecology and evolution might affect students' views on the 
nature  of  science,  we  endeavored  to  explore  this  potential  connection  in  the 
context  of  a  course  entitled  Topics  in  Ecology  and  Evolution.    In  this  course, 
students  were  guided  toward  understanding  how  the  science  reported  in 
individual research articles contributed to a broader understanding of different 
natural  phenomena.  Students  read  several  primary  research  literature  articles 
per week and participated in online discussions wherein they posted summaries 
of and responses to the assigned research papers, explored their thoughts on the 
papers,  and  described  what  types  of  projects  they  expected  the  researchers 
might  pursue  next.  They  were  taught  to  read  through  these  research  articles 
following  the  CREATE  (Consider,  Read,  Elucidate  hypotheses,  Assess  the 
methods  and  data,  Think  of  the  next  Experiment)  approach  developed  by 
Hoskins et al. (2011). Additionally, the online discussion board was set up such 
that each student would have to submit a response to the assigned article before 
being able to see any postings from their peers. This arrangement was to ensure 
that  the  students  would  have  to  construct  their  own  responses  to  the  readings 
rather than draw from the responses of their peers.  

After  making  their  own  response  entries  to  the  online  discussion  board, 
students  were  required  to  comment  on  one  another's  responses  online.  All 
readings  and  online  responses  were  required  prior  to  the  in-person  class 
meetings,  and  the  readings  were  thoroughly  dissected  during  class  in  group 
discussion.  After  a  few  class  sessions  of  reading  and  discussing  instructor-
selected  research  articles,  the  students  were  asked  to  choose  topics  and  find 
appropriate readings (both approved by the instructor), and took over the role of 
leading the in-class discussions for the readings they selected for the rest of the 
semester.  

To ascertain the effects this class may have had on the students' nature of 
science  views  and  biological  content  knowledge,  we  administered  previously 
validated  survey  tools  at  the  beginning  and  end  of  the  course  including  the 
Biological  Concept  Inventory  (BCI,  see  appendix  3)  developed  by  Klymkowsky, 
Underwood,  &  Garvin-Doxas  (2010)  and  the  Views  on  the  Nature  of  Science 
survey  instrument    Form  C  (VNOS-C,  see  appendix  4)  as  developed  and 
implemented  by  Abd-El-Khalick  (2001)  and  Lederman,  Abd-El-Khalick,  Bell,  &

Schwartz  (2002).  We  also  made  use  of  written  responses  near  the  end  of  the 
course in which students were asked to describe in detail what they found useful 
about  using  primary  literature,  what  was  challenging,  how  they  felt  they 
progressed in terms of their ability to understand what they were reading, and 
how they felt about choosing their own topics and leading those discussions. (See 
Appendix 5 for the writing prompt.)  

Participants in the study were six students, three male and three female, 
including two biology majors, a forensic science major, one pre-medicine student, 
one undeclared art major, and one undeclared student in the college of arts and 
sciences.  An  additional  student  was  present  for  much  of  the  class,  but  was 
excluded  from  this  study  since  he  did  not  complete  the  course.  Participants 
ranged  in  age  from  18  to  21  years  old,  and  four  were  first-year  university 
students.  Where  students  are  referred  to  by  name  in  this  work,  pseudonyms 
have been assigned. Use of data for research purposes was voluntary. Also, due 
to  technological  issues  with  the  online  version  of  the  VNOS  instrument, 
responses  were  not  recorded  for  one  student  (Lauren)  pre-course,  or  for  a 
different  student  (Stuart)  post-course.  All  data  were  collected  under  IRB 
authorised protocols. 

We  employed  the  coding  recommendations  for  the  VNOS-C  as  in 
Lederman  et  al.  (2002)  to  classify  students  views  of  various  aspects  of  NOS as 
being  more  nave  or  more  informed  or  as  mixed  when  elements  of  informed 
views  were  expressed  but  the  responses  were  incomplete  or  when  elements  of 
informed  views  were  express  along  with  nave  elements.  Unfortunately,  follow-
up interviews relating to VNOS responses were not conducted due to constraints 
related  to  our  IRB  authorization  for  data  collection.  Responses  to  the  VNOS-C 
questionnaire  were  independently  rated  by  the  two  co-authors  and  thereafter 
discussed in conference. The raters independent scorings were in agreement for 
96.4% of the participant responses, and where there were differences, these were 
reconciled  via  inter-rater  discussion.  Examples  of  responses  for  each  category 
are presented in Table 1.

Header: Results and Discussions  
Effects of the course on students' views about the nature of science 

VNOS-C  results,  shown  in  Table  2,  were  quite  positive.  There  were 
decreases  in  naive  responses  and  increases  in  mixed  and  informed 
responses in all but one NOS category. The only NOS aspect without a decrease 
in  naive  responses  was  the  theory/law  aspect,  which  was  never  explicitly 
addressed in class. Naive responses also persisted fairly strongly with regards to 
the myth of the singular scientific method, the idea that there is only one way to 
do  science,  typically  in  the  familiar,  step-wise  fashion  presented  in  many 
primary-  and  secondary-level  textbooks.  Sadly,  although  many  of  the  readings 
discussed in class were observational rather than experimental studies, the view 
that all science requires experiments still persisted.

students  as  represented  by  the  relevant  questions  on  the  VNOS-C  instrument  (Lederman  et  al.,

Along with higher VNOS-C scores, some statements made by the students 
in  their  reflective  written  work  reflect  improving  conceptions  of  NOS  as  well. 
Many of the students thought using primary literature provided insight into how 
science is done in the real world, or in real life. We take this to mean that the 
students were able to view science as less of an abstraction, or perhaps that they 
were better able to focus on the process of science. Ronaldo said, these articles 
showed  how  science  is  applied  in  real  life,  and  Kristin  echoed  that  same 
sentiment,  saying  I  also  feel  that  I  have  a  better  understanding  [of]  how 
research  is  done  in  the  real  world.  Several  students  made  statements  that 
strongly indicate a more informed NOS view. Hilda stated that scientists work 
continuously to bring out their discoveries to [the] world and let other people to 
have more scientific knowledge and attention to science, indicating that she had 
thought  a  lot  about  how  science  is  communicated.  Sam  made  the  statement 
which perhaps indicated the greatest gains in NOS conceptions when he stated,  

I think that science is done in many ways in the real world, and there are 
many different types of science. One example of science is going out to a certain 
area  and  observe  a  specific  species  or  working  in  a  laboratory  seeing  how  an 
animal  reacts  to  something.  There  are  so  many  different  ways  science  is  done 
today. 

It  would  seem  that  the  myth  of  a  single  scientific  method  has  been 

dispelled for Sam.  

Effects of the course on students' biological content knowledge 

Students'  scores  on  the  biological  concept  inventory  (Klymkowsky  et  al., 
2010) did not differ substantially from the beginning to the end of the course, as 
the  BCI  is  intended  to  diagnose  common  misconceptions  across  the  very  broad 
and  interdisciplinary  field  of  biology.  Total  individual  scores  have  a  possible 
range of zero to thirty points. Scores ranged from 8 to 18 at the beginning of the 
course and from 12 to 17  at  the end. The  sum of all students'  scores was  77  at 
the  outset  of  the  course,  and  76  at  the  end.  While  it  would  have  been 
encouraging  if  students  had  been  able  to  overcome  some  of  the  general 
misconceptions they still held, we were not entirely surprised that the students 
retained  some  of  these  often  tenaciously  persistent  nave  conceptions.  With 
regard to more specific content knowledge encountered in this course, there are 
no extant, previously validated tools with which to objectively measure learning 
gains,  nor  could  we  have  anticipated  which  topics  in  particular  the  students 
would  select  at  the  beginning  of  the  course.  Hence,  we  may  only  provide 
students  self-reports  as  evidence  of  their  content-specific  learning,  and  do  not 
consider the results of the BCI to be appropriate for this study. 

The students perceptions of how much and what they learned is, however, 
enlightening  and  encouraging.  83%  of  the  participants  (all  but  one)  indicated 
content knowledge gains in their reflective responses. Hilda, for example, said, 

My knowledge of science has increased incredibly,  not only about specific 
species  that  we  read  about  but  also  about  general  ecology  [and]  evolution... 
Although  I  am  not  an  environment[al]  science  major  nor  was  [I]  interested  in 
ecology,  I  feel  I  have  gained  a  lot  of  scientific  knowledge  on  other  aspects  of 
science.

Sam  said,  I  do  know  that  my  knowledge  of  science  has  increased  after 

taking this class. Ronaldo reported that  

This  class  not  only  improved  my  knowledge  on  science,  but  improved  my 
literature skills as well. I am very grateful I took this class because I now know 
my scientific knowledge and writing skills improved tremendously. 

Lauren also noted an increased understanding of science, saying, this also 
increased my knowledge and understanding of the world around us and how it is 
constantly  changing  to  adapt  to  ever-changing  variables.  It  is  easy  to 
understand the processes that go along with evolution, but seeing examples that 
come  from  our  everyday  life  was  a  completely  different  way  of  learning  and 
beneficial in the long run.  

The  students  clearly 

improved 
understanding of biology as a result of their work with primary literature in the 
course.  

felt  confident  that  they  had  an 

Students' self-described experiences with primary literature 

The  students  had  much  to  say  about  their  experiences  with  primary 
literature. Most had rarely used primary literature in the past. Stuart stated in 
a written response, I read a total of ten or twenty scholarly articles in my entire 
life before enrolling in this course. The other students had similar made similar 
statements about their prior use of primary literature. Sam had apparently had 
the most experience with  primary literature, but stated that before taking [the 
course] I had used primary literature for a class first semester. It was different 
because the other class wasnt a science class so the primary literature was not 
similar.  

Students'  statements  about  how  they  perceived  primary  literature  at  the 
outset  of  the  course  were  also  very  similar  amongst  the  all  students.  Ronaldo 
said, at first these articles were very hard to interpret. Sam echoed the same 
sentiment  when  he  said,  reading  primary  literature  in  the  class  was  difficult 
because I did not have a lot of experience with science articles so I got confused. 
Hilda  expressed  an  interesting  view,  unique  among  the  students  in  this  study, 
but  not  likely  unique  among  student  readers  of  primary  literature,  when  she 
explained  of  research  articles,  although  I  am  a  science  major,  I  thought  they 
were for real scientists who are not I. The perception that research articles are 
only  meant  for  researchers  is,  of  course,  completely  understandable  given  the 
fact  that  many  articles  are  inaccessible  due  to  factors  such  as  subscription 
barriers,  or,  as  cited  by  nearly  every  student,  that  scientific  articles  are 
perceived  as  prohibitively  challenging  due  to  the  complex  and  specialised 
language in which they are written. Sam noted that when reading these articles 
[the] authors always used words I didnt know, so I had to use a dictionary a lot. 
Lauren said of reading research articles, at first, this felt a little overwhelming 
and it was hard to grasp some of the scientific [jargon], and Ronaldo also noted 
that  these  journals  have  an  array  of  vast  scientific  vocabulary,  which  was  the 
hardest thing to get used when dissecting these journals. Kristin pointed not to 
terminology, but to the structure of journal articles as something she struggled 
with early on. She said,  

when I read journals like the ones we went over in this class, it often took 
me a much greater amount of time, mainly due to  an inability to  sit down and

                                                 B. E. CARTER AND J. R. WLES 

read the longer readings word for word all of the way through at once, the way I 
assumed  I  should  read  them.  I  had  no  strategy  for  dissecting  the  information 
given to me.  

This  is  an  important  point,  since  many  readers  struggle  with  the  typical 
structure of research articles. In fact, grasping article structure would prove to 
be a turning point for several students.  

As  I  read  more  and  more  I  really  got  [used]  to  them  and  I  started  to 
understand  why  they  were  broken  up  into  sections,  Sam  remarked  about 
reading journal articles. Stuart fleshed this idea out more fully:  

All  of  the  articles  we  read  had  general  trends  in  them  that  made  the 
reading easier to understand. Almost  all of the articles had an abstract  section 
in  the  beginning,  which  summarized  the  entire  experiment  that  the  article 
discussed  in  1-2  short  paragraphs.  After  [that]  an  introduction  would  explain 
what the point of the experiment was. Following the introduction were normally 
the methods and results sections which would explain how the experiments were 
done, and how it ended up working out in the end.  

Ronaldo noted,  

at  first  these  articles  were  very  hard  to  interpret.  The  scholarly  articles 
had  multiple  parts  to  them,  which  in  beginning  seemed  to  be  confusing,  but 
proved to make the article more organized and easy to understand.  

paper 

These  statements  indicate  that  our  decision  to  include  a  guide  to 
examining  research  articles  early  in  the  course  was  a  good  one.  In  one  of  the 
first  reading  sets  in  the  course,  we  made  use  of  materials  from  Berkeley's 
Understanding  Evolution  website  which  provided  a  guide  to  dissecting  a 
scientific 
biology 
about 
(http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/teach/journal/dissectingapaper.php). 
These  materials  provide  a  reading  guide  to  accompany  a  study  of  figs  and  fig 
wasps (Dunn et al., 2008), which provides insight into each of the sections of the 
article.  Though  the  students  did  not  cite  these  materials  explicitly  in  their 
written  work,  these  readings  and  the  accompanying  class  discussion  were  the 
foundation  of  the  students'  initial  guided  experience  with  analyzing  scientific 
articles.  

evolutionary 

Many  students  also  espoused  the  benefits  of  online  and  class  discussions 

for their understandings of the papers. Ronaldo said,  

I  found  the  most  useful  part  of  the  class  came  in  the  discussions.  In  this 
part  of  the  class  not  only  can  you  demonstrate  your  perspective  of  the  articles, 
but  other  student  can  chime  in  and  provide  information  you  would  not  even 
think about.  Thus, giving you a vast knowledge on the topic being discussed in 
class that day.  

Lauren noted that  

eventually it became easier to pick out the key points and summarize after 
seeing  how  other  students  viewed  the  article  and  how  they  interpreted  the 
information. Discussions in class also made  it easier to understand the over all 
goal  of  the  project  and  sharing  thoughts  with  my  peers  also  opens  up  the 
opportunity to discuss possible alternatives to the projects.

Online  and  class  discussions  were  perhaps  most  helpful  to  Hilda,  who 

said,  

There were some articles  that I interpreted wrong and realized what the 
study was actually about during class discussion. If I am in hurry or the article 
gets confusing, I tend to get lost easily and end up with wrong interpretation of 
the article.  

She  also  noted  that  seeing  other  students'  online  summaries  and 
discussion of the readings about which she was to lead discussion was helpful in 
interpreting the thoughts that [she] had and also [she] understood how others 
thought about this issue. Stuart also found discussions helpful in correcting his 
misinterpretations. He said,  

I feel as though the discussions during class really helped to get the point 
of  the  articles  across.  When  reading  them  sometimes  I  wouldnt  understand 
some  of  what  went  on,  but  class  discussions  really  helped  to  clear  up  any 
confusion that I had. 

Students universally described changes in how they experienced primary 
literature.  As  noted  above,  Sam  became  more  familiar  with  the  structure  of 
research  articles  as  he  read  more  of  them.  He  also  said,  I  really  dont  know  if 
my abilities have changed from primary literature because I really havent used 
primary literature outside of this class, but he added, I have practiced reading 
these different articles so if I am required to read primary literature for another 
class I will be able to do it. Stuart said,  

I  feel  like  my  abilities  to  read  primary  literature  [have]  definitely 
increased since I began taking this class. I feel more confident when reading it 
because the types of articles we read are all written the same way. 

Kristin  said,  I  feel  that  my  skills  in  understanding  how  to  interpret 
primary literature have increased in this course.  Hilda noted, I can now read 
faster  but  still  [make]  notes  and  highlights  to  understand  better  about  the 
studies.  Ronaldo  was  very  specific  in  how  he  described  his  semester-long 
experience: 

Coming  into  this  class  I  had  no  clue  how  to  even  dissect  these  types  of 
scholarly  articles...  It  may  have  seemed  repetitive  doing  the  same  thing  every 
week, but with every new week each reply and summary took less time.  

Lauren  also  found  repetition  helpful,  saying  Over  the  course  of  this 
semester,  my  ability  to  understand  and  decipher  articles  has  greatly  improved 
due to the amount of practice we have been doing.  

It  is  clear  that  more  practice  with  reading  original  research  was  helpful 
for the students, but did the skills they gained in this course carry over to other 
courses or more broadly to other parts of their lives? Many students thought so. 
Kristin stated,  

I definitely feel more [confident] in my skills of reading and understanding 
journal  articles,  and  it  is  something  that  has  already  begun  helping  me  in  my 
current classes that require journal readings. Currently I am in a lab course in 
which a significant part of my grade was based on reading and understanding a 
long  research  paper.  At  the  beginning  of  the  semester  I  dreaded  putting  it  off,

but because of how this course broke down how to summarize and understand a 
paper I was able to complete the assignment with ease. 

Hilda noted, more briefly, As  this course is ending, I feel more prepared 
to [enter a] science career. Lauren found the methodical way of reading articles 
that  she  developed  very  helpful,  as  she  explained,  I  eventually  figured  out  a 
method  that  best  worked  for  me  when  reading  through  articles  to  make  sure 
that I do not miss the key points and have gone on to use this in several of my 
other classes. Ronaldo said,  

With  all  the  lessons  and  skills  I  learned  from  this  class  I  feel  more 
prepared  for  future  science  classes,  an  also  my  future  in  my  scientific  career.  I 
realize  that  I  do  not  want  to  pursue  a  career  and  research,  because  of  all  the 
writing that comes with it.  

Perhaps  the  last  part  is  disheartening,  but  the  realization  that  science 
involves writing is not without merit.  Sam said, I did become more confident in 
my  abilities  in  science  after  this  class,  its  almost  like  practicing.  I  think  this 
class has opened my mind up more than prepared me for other classes. Stuart 
spoke broadly about his gains in confidence, but also predicted that the skills he 
has gained will lead to success in his chosen field, saying,  

This class has definitely made me more confident in the field of science. I 
understand how to read journal articles a lot more than I did before, and I feel 
as  though  this  class  has  made  me  able  to  locate  information  within  journal 
articles  much  more  quickly  than  I  could  before.  Since  I  hope  to  work  with 
animals  one  day,  I  feel  as  though  this  class  has  taught  me  how  to  better 
interpret information when reading scholarly articles. 

It is clear  that  some students felt their experience with original research 

either was already helping them in other pursuits or would in the future.  

One student, Lauren, also confirmed what many science teachers suspect 
about self-selected topics, that they lead to increased investment and a generally 
more positive experience for the student. In her words:  

This was one of the more fulfilling projects I have been a part of because 
not only were you able to research a project that pertained to your interests, you 
were able to hear what your peers thought of the topic as well as educate them 
on what can be/has been done which was a major plus for me. 

It  would  seem  that  self-directed  projects  using  primary  literature  can  be 
quite  positive  for  students,  and  may  be  especially  effective  when  done  with  a 
large amount of class discussion.

Analyzing the VNOS results along with the students personal reflections 
demonstrates  that  similar  results  were  observed  using  different  measures  and 
indicates  that  students  self-professed  gains  are  truly  indicative  of  advances  in 
their thinking. However, a full comparison is difficult given two of the students 
did not complete the VNOS both pre- and post-course. Of the four students who 
did  complete  all  constructs,  all  showed  gains  in  at  least  some  aspects  of  their 
NOS  conceptions,  and  all  claimed  to  have  gained  insight  into  the  scientific 
process in their reflective writings. Additionally, three of the four claimed gains

In the introductory chapter, developing self-awareness was a key pro-
cess outlined and it was stated that it is possible you have assumed that 
the way you view the world is the same as the way that everybody else 
views the world. The term common sense was used in this discussion. 
We noted then, you could believe it is common sense that the way you 
look at the world is the same way that others look at it. However, we also 
saw earlier that one persons common sense is not necessarily the same 
as anothers! If we accept that there are likely to be differences between 
peoples view of the world, it may not come as a surprise that the way 
some researchers view the world, is very different from others views.

Header: 1. Introduction 
Biology is the science of life. It examines the materials and processes of life in its varied forms 
of  existence,  from  the  smallest  molecular  interaction  on  a  gene,  to  the  large  evolutionary 
changes  of  animal  morphology  across  millennia.  Biology1  is  an  enormous  field  that 
encompasses  many  schools  of  thought  and  many  more  research  disciplines.2  For  example, 
microbiology is concerned with micro-organisms such as yeast and bacteria; protistology deals 
with the branch of the unicellular proto-animals; plant biology encompasses all studies on plants 
and  plant  growth;  developmental  biology  examines  the  features  of  ontogenesis,  including 
genetics, molecular,  and cell biology; molecular biology pays attention to gene function in the 
cell;  cell  biology  to  the  anatomy,  biochemistry,  and  divisions  of  labor  within  the  cell; 
evolutionary biology to the phylogenetic development of the forms and functions of genes, gene 
products,  cell  types,  and  whole  organisms  over  the  course  of  many  thousands  of  re-iterative 
generations together. Basic biological research contributes to our understanding of the materials 
and  processes  of  lifes  functions  from  the  molecule  through  the  cell,  to  the  structures  and 

functions of whole, living organisms.  

What  life  actually  is  is  another  question  altogether.3  Biological  research  aims  to  define  the 
substances of living things, their characteristics, and their inter-relations, but what life is is still 
unclear.  The  recognized  biological  characteristics  are  the  cell  (the  simplest  living  unit),  self-
formation (ontogenesis), and reproduction (heredity), all of which exist and continue to exist in 
processes  that  create  living  order  out  of  dead  disorder.  Living  things  have  negative 
entropy:  they  exist  at  a  sustained  higher  energy  state  than  their surroundings  and  in  doing  so 
defy the second law of thermodynamics. Life therefore represents the transformation of energy 
from  disorder  to  a  sustained  order.  Life  is  all  of  these  things,  and  perhaps  more.  Whitehead 
suggests that experience is also a part of life, yet this is a philosophical notion that is difficult to 

explore in mainstream biology itself. 

Biology  is  strictly  a  modern  science  and  in  that  sense  it  is  a  pragmatic  one,  and  is  not 
philosophical.  A  strict  adherence  to  the  scientific  method  lies  at  the  heart  of  the  biological 
sciences; it is the only acceptable form of data acquisition and ties biologists to an empirically 
driven,  verifiable  view  of  external  reality.  Biology  is  not  concerned  with  features  of 
phenomenal  experience,  but  it  prides  itself  on  a  strict  materialism  where  third-party 
observations  of  biological  form  and  function  are  the  exclusive  basis  for  a  world-view.  A 
mechanistic,  material  determinism  forms  the  dominant  philosophical  position  by  proxy,

underpinning  interpretations  of  biological  data  and  theory.  Interestingly,  biologists  commonly 
do not consider theirs to be a philosophical position at all, but rather they view their method as 
uncovering reality itself, testable and verifiable through quantitative empirical research. Matter, 
such  as  ions,  proteins,  and  nucleic  acids,  is  treated  as  passive  and  predicatively  reactive.  The 
behavior of materials in living things is therefore investigated according to mechanical, clock-
work models of causal relations. Modern informatics and complex systems approaches, though 
more  sophisticated  in  their  principles,  do  not  differ  from  other  models  in  their  underlying 
assumption  that  a  material  determinism  identifies  truthfully  what  there  is.  Organisms  in 
biology  are  treated  as  complex  arrangements  of  passive  reactions  arranged  in  biologically 
functional networks.  

Perhaps  due  to  the  remarkable  technological  applications  of  a  deterministic  biology,  any 
serious philosophical alternative to determinism seems difficult for most professional biologists 
to  accept.  This  discrepancy  between  science  and  philosophy  is  long  standing.  Loeb  remarked, 
Science is not the field of definitions, but of prediction and control (1916, vi). In other words, 
Loeb  was  suggesting  that  science  is  not  philosophical,  but  is  geared  for  industrial  means. 
Materialism  has  been  remarkably  successful  at  advancing  our  understanding  and  useful 
manipulation of nature. Using the Newtonian conception of matter and the scientific method for 
verifying  experimental  phenomena,  biology  has  excelled  in  its  ability  to  grasp  defining 
characteristics  of  living  organisms.  The  benefits  of  this  knowledge  contribute  significantly  to 
the  betterment  of  society  through  their  application  in  medicine,  veterinary  medicine,  animal 
husbandry, and agriculture. It is hard to argue that an alternative philosophical position, such as 
Whiteheads, might be appropriate to consider, especially when one considers that the marvels 
of  modern  biomedicine  made  possible  by  the  mechanistic  outlook.  Surgeons  can  replace  a 
failing heart, mend debilitating neurological dysfunction, and safely remove a potentially fatal 
carcinoma. These operations would not be successful without an in-depth understanding of the 
mechanisms  of  life,  from  the  molecular  detail  of  immunoreactivity  to  the  gross  physiological 
conditions  necessary  for  sustained  vital  function.  Biological  knowledge  has  built  modern 
medicine and further contributed to societal well-being through increased agricultural yields and 
prophylactic health measures such as vaccine, hygiene, and sanitation.  

As a form of prediction and control biology is an immensely satisfying body of knowledge. 
However, something remains unsatisfactory and the pragmatic logic of a material determinism 
cannot  overcome  ones  personal  feeling  of  what  it  is  to  be  alive.  And  perhaps  this  is  what  is 
missing.  Biology  knows  nothing  of  feelings,  yet  they  are  inextricably,  unequivocally, 
undeniably a feature of our natural world. We know they are, because we are them; they are our 

experience of the world.

Header: 2. Whiteheads Philosophy of Organism 
Whitehead  envisaged  everything  in  the  world,  all  the  multitude  of  entities  from  subatomic 
particles  to  molecules  and  men,  as  organisms  in  their  own  right.  In  his  famous  dictum, 
Biology  is  the  study  of  the  larger  organisms,  whereas  Physics  is  the  study  of  smaller 
organisms (SMW 145),  Whitehead sums up his conception that all aspects of nature, even the 
apparently inanimate particles of matter, are active self-determining entities each with its public 
and private aspect, and each existing in physical and mental space, insofar as all organisms are. 
This remarkable shift in position was very much opposed to dominant scientific thought at the 
time,  and  remains  so  today.  Matter  was  and  is  treated  by  science  as  dead,  insentient,  and 
predicatively  reactive.  Whiteheads  philosophy  of  organism  turns  this  notion  on  its  head  and 
considers  instead  that  what  we  know  as  matter  is  a  prehended  feeling  of  the  objectification  of 
another  subjective  center.  Actual  occasions  of  experience  are  the  fundamental  units  of  the 
world,  not  quarks  or  atoms  or  cells,  and  actual  occasions  are  felt  experiences  that  extend  over 

time expressing at least some degree of self-determinacy. 

For  the  sake  of  a  quick  introduction  to  his  philosophy  of  organism,  here  it  is  in  a  nutshell. 
Imagine that nothing exists except for a single atom, which is you. What is your experience of 
the world? You have none, because there is nothing to experience. In fact, one might be tempted 
to  say  that  you  do  not  exist  at  all,  if  existence  requires  some  form  of  experience.  Now,  lets 
place another atom next to you. What are you now? You are now the totality of your interaction 
with that other atom. Your experience of what you are and what the world is is all that you are, 
in relation to all that that other atom is. A student of Whitehead summarizes this line of thought: 
Actual  entities  arise  out  of  their  prehensions  of  each  other;  this  secures  the  solidarity  of  the 
order  of  nature.  But  they  have  also  their  private  and  unique  side,  since  each  organizes  its 
prehensions of the rest of the world into the forming of its own real internal constitution in its 
peculiar  way  (Emmet  1966,  89).  Thus,  the  actual  entity  (synonymous  for  actual  occasion)  is 
not  merely  material,  but  carries  with  it  some  organic  qualities.  It  is  the  growing  together  of 
many things into a new unity; the many become one and are increased by one, (PR 21 [31]); it 
is  a  unit  of  becoming  (e.g.  PR  26  [38]);  and  it  acts  with  an  immanent  teleology  toward 
satisfaction (e.g. PR 26 [38]). An actual occasion is a fundamental drop of experience (PR 

18 [28]). 

For  the  biologist,  Whitehead  draws  on  features  of  biological  organization  viewed  from  the 
experience  of  each  part,  with  an  eye  to  its  contribution  to  the  whole.  Actual  occasions  are 
experiential  moments  that  are  viewed  as  the  fundamental  building  blocks  of  the  universe. 
What  we have come to know of as  atoms and molecules can be  further  analyzed  as small 
societies  of  actual  occasions  contributing  to  a  greater  envelope,  such  as  a  macromolecular 
complex  or  protein,  cellular  organelle,  or  whole  cell.  Working  up  in  scale  we  can  see 
that cells, cell systems, and whole organisms are also societies of actual occasions, each 
experiencing its world at its level of existence with the uniqueness of its own character, its own 
physical  composition.  Each  of  these  levels  or  organizations  can  be  explained  in  terms  of  the 

 
4 

Jonathan Delafied-Butt 

coming  together  of  nexs  of  actual  occasions  into  more  complex  forms.4  Thus,  in 
Whiteheads ontology each of these levels of biological organization are not simply physical but 

have some characteristics of mind also.  

Whiteheads  philosophy  of  organism  helps  to  define  biological  organization  in  terms  of  the 
hierarchical  structure  of  nested  relations  within  living  systems,  where  systems  exist  within 

systems, which exist within systems and so on. As Chakraborty writes: 

The  physical  particles  are  in  the  atoms,  the  atoms  are  in  the  molecules,  the 
molecules are in the colloidal aggregates, the latter are in the living cells, the cells 
are  within  the  organs,  and  these  again  within  the  living  bodies,  and  finally  the 
bodies are within the social aggregates, of which there are aggregates of aggregates 
(1997). 

Relational,  nested  organization  is  a  hallmark  of  biological  systems.  In  Whiteheads  terms,  a 
molecule  is  a  subordinate  society  in  the  structured  society  we  call  the  living  cell  (PR  99 
[151]).

Header: 3. Whiteheads Philosophy of Organism in Biology 
3.1. Cultural Differences 
There  are  some  major  obstacles  blocking  the  incorporation  of  Whiteheadian  process  thought 
into mainstream biological thought, not least of which is the taboo against considering mind 
as a feature of  anything but the human cerebral cortex.  Whiteheads concept of the fallacy of 
misplaced  concreteness  (SMW  64,  72)  is  unknown  to  the  biological  community,  precisely 
because  the  biological  community  is  not  a  philosophically  oriented  one,  but  is  rather  a 
pragmatically oriented one. The philosophy of organism also tends to downplay mechanism, or 
rather  it  couches  it  in  such  abstract  terms  and  references  that  it  becomes  unrecognizable. 
Biological  mechanism  is  a  clear  feature  of  existence  and  is  readily  accessible  to  experimental 
manipulation.  The  distinctly  Whiteheadian  features  are  clear  features  of  existence  as  well,  but 
they are intangible and teleological. Intangible notions cannot easily be probed, and teleology is 
marred  by  loose  associations  with  an  impracticable  ultimate  divine  purpose.  In  the  culture  of 
competitive biological research, the intangible, the teleological, and the divine are subjects to be 
avoided. They are, for all intents and purposes, not testable and therefore untenable. This places 
them  outside  the  realm  of  biology,  which  should  instead  work  on  tangible,  mechanical 
problems. 

Whiteheads means of articulation also renders his ontology largely inaccessible to scientists 
raised on a very different culture of language and ideas. Simply put, most biologists do not have 
the  time  or  inclination  to  study  a  philosophy  of  esoteric  notions  such  as  the  Category  of  the 
Ultimate, eight Categories of Existence, twenty-seven Categories of Explanation, and nine 
Categoreal  Obligations  (PR,  18-30  [27-45]),  not  to  mention  prehensions,  actual 
occasions,  nexs,  and  structured  societies.  Whiteheads  language  seems  very  remote  to 
many biologists, who are adept in specialized laboratory processes and observations, but not in 
the  very  general  abstractions  required  by  Whitehead.  Furthermore,  Whiteheads  preoccupation 
with  uncovering  underlying  truths,  involved  in  the  meaning  of  every  particular  notion 

Biology 

5 

respecting  the  actions  of  things  (PR,  17  [25])  is  not  shared  by  many  biologists  who  seek  to 
solve  particular  problems.  Such  divergent  cultures  with  different  objectives  apparently  repel 

each other and make incompatible bedfellows.  

3.2. Possible Solutions to Biological Problems 
However, there are biological problems which have not been addressed by mainstream biology 
but to which Whiteheadian process thought may supply possible solutions. These are: (1) goal-
directed  activity  in  organisms;  (2)  creative  adaptation;  (3)  the  composition  and  unification  of 
wholes  from  parts;  and  finally  (4)  the  relation  of  mind  and  matter.  These  questions  lie  very 
much  at  the  heart  of  biologythe  study  of  what  life  isyet  they  are  ignored  by  mainstream 
biological research.  

We will take up each of these problems in turn. First, with regard to goal-directed behavior in 
biological systems, it is clear that biological systems  adopt means to  achieve  ends.  A paradise 
bird  will  perform  an  elaborate  courtship  ritual  to  win  a  mate;  a  football  player  will  perform 
sensorimotor  control  to  score  a  goal;  a  bacterium  will  move  to  find  food.  Means  to  ends  is 
teleological action. In Whiteheadian terms, such actions are referred to as immanent, immediate 

teleologies expressed in the existence of every actual occasion (PR 214 [327]).  

Second, creativity, particularly in adaptive action to acquire ends, is considered by Whitehead 
to  be  a  fundamental  aspect  of  organic  existence.  Adaptive  response,  creativity,  and  by 
extension, evolution are observable features of the natural  world. In biology these features  are 
explained awayby means of statistical probabilities in complex information processing in the 
case  of  adaptive  and  creative  behaviors  in  individuals,  or  by  simple  statistical  probabilities  in 
the  case  of  evolutionary  change  through  mutation  and  preservation  of  chance  variations.  The 
philosophy of organism, on the other hand, places these features at the very heart of what-there-
is.  

Third,  the  unification  of  parts  to  form  new  wholes  that  give  rise  to  emergent  properties  is 
returning as a question of interest in systems biology. For Whitehead, these emergent features of 
nature  are  not  considered  as  secondary,  merely  arising  from  primary  physical  laws,  but  are 
themselves primary laws, and so Whitehead prescribes to them his Category of the Ultimate 
(PR 21 [31]). In other words, the features of existence that we recognize in our lives as being a 
part of our experience and activity in life, the experiential features that are part of our mind, are 
considered  by  Whitehead  to  be  fundamental  to  existence  per  se.  The  way  in  which  these 
features are expressed manifests in different physical forms across many spatiotemporal scales; 
these are the things we recognize as organisms. Thus, parts form wholes and wholes are parts 
in larger wholes. Whole organisms experience and act with a degree of unity, and therefore a 
degree  of  unity  of  experience  and  of  self-determination.  The  many  become  one  and  are 

increased by one (PR 21 [31]).  

Finally, we must note the quantum  chemical lynchpin that underlies all living things, indeed 
all  non-living  chemistry  too.  The  quantum  chemical  lynchpin  is the  most  basic  foundation  for 
any biological system: all biological systems are powered, and their activities directed through 
biochemical reactions (cf. transformations) that proceed by quantum events. Mechanical events 
exist at a larger spatiotemporal level, events that are themselves determined by quantum ones. 

 
6 

Jonathan Delafied-Butt 

The  structure  and  function  of  all  organisms  is  dependent  on  these  of  quantum  laws  and 
therefore  quantum  laws  underpin  Newtonian  mechanics.  The  question  for  biology  rests  very 
much on  whether or not these cumulative quantum interactions between and  within molecules 
have  any  relevance  for  the  form  and  function  of  a  cell  or  multicellular  organism.  Some  might 
say they do, that they are fundamental to its structure and activity. Others might say they do not, 

that they are just the peculiarities of an atomic world. 

A  Whiteheadian  conception  of  organism  can  be  seen  as  harmonizing  successfully  with 
quantum  laws,  where  an  approach  based  on  a  mechanistic  determinism  simply  cannot.5  In 
particular,  Whiteheads  occasions  of  experience  have  been  argued  to  be  related  to  quantum 
events,6  which  would  bring  our  philosophical  understanding  of  nature  in  line  with  data  from 
modern  physics.  While  a  level  of  explanation  of  biological  systems  at  the  quantum  level  may 
seem remote and distant to the practical problems of biology, we must consider that our system 
of understanding of life must include all scientific laws and all available data on life, regardless 
of  cultural  taboo  or  current  trends  in  R.A.E.-compatibility.  Quantum  events,  mind  and  matter, 
wholes from parts, creativity, and goal-directed activity are all valid, verifiable features of life 

on which a wealth of data is available to be considered and discussed. 

A  recent  resurgence  in  Systems  Biology  is  a  welcome  attempt  to  reintegrate  the  disparate 
fractions of data acquired by the reductionist project of the twentieth century. Systems biology 
is rapidly coming into vogue as the shining new field in the biological sciences, spurred on by a 
post-genomic effort to understand integrated biological systems.7 However, no philosophical re-
interpretation  of  the  mechanistic  paradigm  appears  forthcoming,  leaving  the  reintegration  of 
data  to  be  tied  together  bit  by  bit,  a  technique  embedded  in  a  reductive,  deterministic  world-
view.  It  would  be  interesting  to  see  if  Whiteheads  philosophy of  organism  could  lend  a hand 
here with some novel and more complete conceptions of whole systems biology.  

4. Whiteheadian Biologists 

Whiteheads  influence  in  biology  is  limited  and  has  not  shifted  the  dominant  view  that  an 
understanding of the organism  can be achieved by an  understanding of the physical properties 
of its constituent parts. However, in the early twentieth century Whiteheads work was noticed 
by  a  small  and  important  cluster  of  biologists  centered  in  London  and  Cambridge.  These  two 
cities  produced  two  streams  of  biological  research  that  were  based  on,  or  had  been  influenced 
by  Whiteheads  developing  metaphysics  of  organism;  and  in  turn,  Whiteheads  metaphysics 

was probably influenced by them.  

First,  Joseph  Woodger  at  the  University  of  London  was  a  principal  character  in  extending 
Whiteheads  philosophy  into  biological  thought.  Woodgers  career  is  marked  by  his  extensive 
contribution  to  studies  on  biological  form  and  function,  and  especially  on  their  hierarchical 
arrangement.8 His seminal text, Biological Principles,9 expounded a Whiteheadian organicism, 
emphasizing that parts are only what they are because of, and can only be understood in terms 
of, their contribution to the whole. Moreover, he emphasized an existentialism of the parts that 
equates with Whiteheads general notion of pan-experientialism. Woodger attempted to provide 

Biology 

7 

biology with a logical foundation on which observations, theories, and methods could be based. 
He  classified  the  components  of  an  organism  on  a  scale  of  increasing  size  and  complexity, 
molecular,  macromolecular,  cell  components,  cells,  tissues,  organs,  and  organ  systems,  and 
noted  that  each  class  exhibits  new  modes  of  behavior,  which  cannot  be  interpreted  as  being 

merely additive phenomena from the previous class. 

Woodgers  thinking  about  biological  principles  influenced  two  young  colleagues  in 
Cambridge,  both  of  whom  went  on  to  become  eminent  developmental  biologists.  On  the  one 
hand  there  was  Joseph  Needham,  a  charismatic  scientist  who  would  later  bridge  Chinese  and 
Western  science,10  and  on  the  other  there  was  Conrad  Hal  Waddington,  perhaps  the  most 
influential  figure  from  the  Whiteheadian  school  of  thought  in  modern  biology,  and  an  avid 
Whiteheadian  scholar.  Interestingly,  these  three  biologists  were  closely  related  to  Whitehead 

spatiotemporally. They formed, may we venture, a nexus of thought.  

Waddington and Needham began work on issues of embryogenesis in Hopkins Laboratory of 
Biochemistry at  Cambridge around 1928, a cornerstone laboratory in the field of biochemistry 
historically famous for its creativity, breadth and depth of research into the molecular basis of 
life.11  Hopkins  was  particularly  encouraging  of 
individual  creativity  and  welcomed 
Waddingtons  enthusiasm  to  study  the  biochemistry  of  embryogenesis,  a  field  not  yet  opened 
for  research.  Together,  Needham  and  Waddington  worked  on  the  question:  how  does  a  single 
cell,  a  perfectly  round  fertilized  ovum,  develop  into  an  intricate  system  of  many  different  cell 
types,  organized  in  predictable  patterns,  to  form  a  particular  kind  of  living  animal?  Their 
research lead to the discovery of signaling centers, areas of the embryo specifically invisible to 
the  eye,  but  containing  within  them  the  potential  to  induce  other  tissues  to  differentiate  into 
patterned structures.12  

The  presence  of  evocator  and  reactive  tissue  is  now  a  cornerstone  of  developmental 
biology  and  has  since  been  worked  up  to  further  demonstrate  the  importance  of  reciprocal 
relations between parts. Evocator tissues are now known as signaling centers, areas with distinct 
gene  expression  yet  often  no  morphological  difference  with  surrounding  tissue.  Signaling 
centers  influences  reactive  tissue  through  the  effects  of  diffusible  molecules,  and  conversely 
reactive tissue often reciprocally evokes evocator tissue. For example, in utero in the developing 
limb, two mutually-dependent signaling centers exist that work to pattern the bones and muscles 
that  give  rise  to  its  patterned  morphology.  When  one  signaling  center  is  experimentally 
removed,  the  other  ceases  to  function  and  normal  growth  ceases.  Likewise  when  the  other  is 
removed  the  other  ceases  to  function  and  normal  growth  ceases.13  Their  relations  form  each 
other and with creative advance through time both develop new characteristics enabling them 
to  experience  their  world  in  a  more  advanced,  novel  way.  Reciprocating  relations  through 
time is essential to the process of creative advance in life and is a feature that can be observed 
on  any  level  of organization,  from  the  early  subcellular  interactions  of  the  sperm  and  the  egg, 
through development of the organism, to the reciprocal and mutually-dependent interactions of 
organisms in ecosystems.14  

Waddington was an early scholar of Whitehead and it was this interest that led him to pursue 
embryology. It was Whitehead to whose writings [he] paid much more attention [] than [he] 
did  to  the  textbooks  in  subjects  on  which  [he]  was  going  to  take  [his]  exams  (Waddington 

 
8 

Jonathan Delafied-Butt 

1975,  3).  This  early  interest  remained  with  him  throughout  his  life  and  helped  to  form  his 
orientation. In his autobiography he makes it clear that the whole of science was dominated by 
essentially Newtonian  conceptions of billiard-ball atoms existing as durationless instants in an 
otherwise  empty  three-dimensional  space.  It  was  []  Whitehead  who  suggested  new  lines  of 
thought (Waddington 1975, 4). In the 1930s, Waddington established the informal Theoretical 
Biology  Club,  among  whose  interdisciplinary  membership  included  Woodger  and  Needham, 
and  whose  principle  position  was  an  exploration  of  an  organic,  or  Whiteheadian 

understanding of biology. 

The line of thought initiated by this group was carried forward largely, but dissipated into the 
middle of the twentieth century under the strain of the success of the reductionist project; even 
ideas.15  However,  a  new 
Waddington  wavered 
understanding  of  organisms  and  environment  took  hold  in  peripheral  subject  areas,  notably  in 
the  new  fields  of  ecology  and  ethology,  while  ideas  of  organicism  in  mainstream  biology 
continued,  though  in  a  more  subterranean  veinno  longer  did  it  hold  a  principle  position 

in  his  commitment 

to  Whiteheadian 

among rising stars in Cambridge.  

Today,  Whiteheadian  thinking  in  biology  remains  present  in  a  stream  of  quiet,  dissociated 
research  by  modern,  and  often  marginalized  thinkers  such  as  Erwin  Laszlo,  Mae  Wan  Ho, 
Francisco Varela (in cognitive psychology), and others workers such as the Portuguese biologist 
Jos  Anunes  Serra  and  the  Australian  bio-theologian  Charles  Birch.  Additionally,  a  small 
number  of  junior  biologists  are  turning  to  Whitehead  for  theoretical  and  philosophical 
grounding  in  an  attempt  to  understand  apparent  features  such  as  purpose,  co-operativity,  and 
creativity in biological systems, of which I would consider myself one. Most recently and by far 
the most interesting advance in Whiteheadian biological thinking comes from the new  Process 
Philosophy of Chemistry.  Here the principal exponents are Jerry Chandler, Joseph  Earley,  and 
Ross Stein, all of  whom  are  working to advance our understanding of the nature of atoms and 
molecules,  and  the  processes  of  (bio)chemical  transformations  that  they  undergo.  Chemistry 
underpins biology and much of biological research today is molecular in nature, examining the 
chemical process of cell function in its wide variety of forms and functions. A non-reductionist, 
process-led  understanding  of  chemistry  together  with  a  better  understanding  of  quantum 
chemistry is building a foundation for a useful Whiteheadian paradigm in modern biology.  

Erwin Laszlo is one of the most broad and extensive thinkers who firmly grounded his initial 
work  in  biological  data.  He  produced  a  rare  and  interesting  synthesis  of  empirical  data  with 
Whiteheadian  process  metaphysics,  his  generalized  Systems  Philosophy.16  This  work  is 
essential  grounding  for  any  biological  thinker.  Laszlo  combined  pioneering  ideas  in  systems 
theory and cyberneticswork that studied relations between parts to obtain goals, namely that 
of  Woodger and Bertalannfywith  Whiteheads philosophy of organism to advance a general 
organic biology. This work from the 1970s produced a rigorous theoretical structure grounded 
firmly  in  empirical  data.  He  drew  on  features  of  nested  relationships,  systems  energetics,  and 
organic  hierarchical  organization  to  develop  a  framework  for  biological  organization  and 
activity.  Unfortunately,  Laszlos  Systems  Philosophy,  like  Lovelocks  Gaia  Theory,  was  not 
generally accepted by mainstream academic thought, but remains today on the periphery as an 

interesting and insightful synthesis.  

Biology

Despite the difficulties of considering organicism in this culture, a modern biologist Mae Wan 
Ho  (1998)  recently  devised  an  insightful  and  plausible  hypothesis  of  organism  in  line  with 
Whiteheads  metaphysics  and  taking  into  account  Laszlos  work.  She  further  incorporated 
recent  data  from  cell  biology,  including  her  own  novel  observations  on  phase  shift  in  cells. 
Together, she worked to produce a hypothesis of coherence in the molecules of a cell or group 

of cells based on their quantum alignment. This hypothesis has not been tested. 

The  connection  between  mind  and  body  is  a  difficult one  to  reconcile  in  biology.  Francesco 
Varela  has  worked  to  bridge  cognitive  neuroscience  with  the  biological  material  of  the  body, 
and  thus  to  bring  notions  of  mind  into  the  material  that  gives  rise  to  it.  Though  he  rarely 
referenced  Whitehead directly, a distinct Whiteheadian flavor can be found in his writings and 
research  in  his  emphasis  on  embodiment.17  He  brings  returns  an  abstracted  and  overly 
intellectual notion of mind from cognitive neuroscience back into the material of the body.  

Wilfred  Agar  worked  in  Australia  in  the  early  twentieth  Century,  like  his  British 
contemporaries, to forward an organic, Whiteheadian understanding of life within the context of 
biological thinking.18 His text, A Contribution to the Theory of the Living Organism (1943) is a 
thorough-going  synthesis  of  the  philosophy  of  organism  in  light  of  biological  data,  with 
emphasis on the qualities and characteristics that make up the organism. His colleague, Charles 
Birch, has further extended this thinking to take into account the ethical considerations that such 
a position brings (1999). Birch adds a spiritual, or religious dimension that other Whiteheadian 

biologists tend to eschew. 

Taken  together,  Whiteheadian  thinking  in  biology  is  clearly  marginal,  yet  it  remains  an 
attractive  and  potentially  useful  system  of  understanding  for  questions  still  to  be  addressed 

within the domain of the biological sciences.

Header: 5. Prospects for Whiteheadian Thought in Biology 
The old rift between mechanism and forms of subjectivism (e.g. vitalism and organicism) is still 
alive  today,  though  the  mechanistic  position  clearly  dominates  the  academic  landscape, 
commanding  an  overwhelming  majority  of  the  research  money  and  therefore  scientific  and 
social  influence.  It  is  clear  that  mechanism  yields  results  of  pragmatic  material  benefit,  while 
also subjectivism yields results of sympathetic, cultural human importance. For example, in the 
field of psychosomatic medicine there are clearly biological mechanisms at  work behind some 
symptomologies,  but  behind  others  lie  psychosocial  conditions.  The  interplay  between 
biological mechanism and psychological condition is an indistinct, yet a vitally important one.  

The  strength  of  science  is  scientific  methodology.  The  success  of  biomedicine,  based  on  a 
mechanistic  determinism,  acts  as  a  bulwark  against  alternative  interpretations  of  nature. 
However,  there  is  no  reason  why  alternative  philosophical  positions,  such  as  Whiteheads, 
cannot  work  with  the  scientific  method.  It  is  the  scientific  method  that  is  important,  not 
necessarily material determinism. One must disentangle determinism from science; the two are 
too  closely  associated.  Science  is  the  application  of  the  scientific  method.  Philosophy  is  a 
general systematization of thought (PR, 17 [25-26]). 

 
10 

Jonathan Delafied-Butt 

The scientific method is straightforward and uncontroversial. Each piece of acquired scientific 
data stands alone  as a truth.  Once verified, these truths form  a solid basis on  which to form 
opinions,  ideas,  and  hypotheses  for  other  potentially  useful  truths.  Scientific  advance  works 
marvelously  in  this  way,  each  dataset  working  as  a  stepping-stone  in  a  world  of  uncertainty. 
Importantly,  the  data  itself  always  remains  untainted  by  philosophical  considerations.  It  is 
simply  what  it  is.  However,  the  way  in  which  data  is  interpreted  is  subject  to  philosophical 
position. Waddington remarks: I do not see that [my metaphysical beliefs] have had any direct 
influence  on  the  way  in  which  I  have  conducted  experimental  work  []  (1975,  5).  Yet, 
Waddington  adds,  I  should  like  to  argue  that  a  scientists  metaphysical  beliefs  are  not  mere 
epiphenomena,  but  have  a  definite  and  ascertainable  influence  on  the  work  he  produces  [] 
(1975, 1). The scientific work remains the business of science, but the scientists philosophical 
position influences the direction that that work takes. Science and philosophy mingle, one step 
at  a  time.  The  data  themselves  remain  untainted  by  the  philosophical  position,  but  the  way  in 
which the data are interpreted are subject to influence by philosophy. A stepping-stone process 
forms  where  the  data  remain  solid,  verifiable  phenomena  and  the  interpretive  and  subsequent 
planning phases are influenced by philosophy.  

One  reason  that  material  determinism  is  so  successful  is  perhaps  circularthe  underpinning 
mechanistic philosophy drives the research to look for mechanisms, and  when they  are found, 
verifies the assumption. Likewise, a process metaphysic-led research programme could take off 
in a new direction, also forming its own tautology. In  this way, the stepping-stones of testable 
biological  data  can  be  used  by  any  party,  or  any  philosophical  position,  but  the  direction  that 
one  takes  from  each  stepping-stone  to  the  next  is  wholly  determined  by  ones  philosophical 
position.  The  direction  dictates  the  appearance  of  the  next  stepping-stone  and  the  direction  is 
philosophically  oriented.  Process  thought  can  potentially  contribute  equally  as  well  to  the 
direction  of  scientific  advance  as  material  determinism;  its  success  will  depend  on  the  critical 
and rigorous application of the scientific method to genuinely interesting and useful questions.

Header: 6. Concluding Remarks 
Whiteheads  cosmology  makes  sense  of  the  bifurcated  nature  of  existence,  the  private 
experiential and the public objective aspects. The distinction between publicity and privacy is a 
distinction  of  reason,  and  is  not  a  distinction  between  mutually  exclusive  concrete  facts  (PR 
290 [444]). In his efforts to form a more complete doctrine of what the world is made of, the 
theory of prehensions [was] founded upon the doctrine that there are no concrete facts which are 
merely public, or merely private. Biologists know this to be true through increasing dissections 
upon  dissections  of  an  organism.  To  discover  the  private  aspect  of  an  organism,  biology 
penetrates its material to reveal complex mechanisms of material action in anatomy, physiology, 
cell  biology,  and  biochemistry.  However,  with  each  reduction  we  are  again  confronted  with  a 
private  and  public  entity: in  dissection  of the  human body  a  heart  is  revealed,  in  dissection  of 
the heart chambers are revealed, in dissection of the chambers cells are revealed, in dissection of 
the  cells  cell  organelles  are  revealed,  in  dissection  of  the  organelles  macromolecules  are 

Biology 

11 

revealed, and so on until we examine the world of the individual atoms, subatomic particles, the 
particles  of  those  particles.  There  is  no  end  to  the  dissection  that  science  is  aware  of;  always 

there is a public and private aspect.  

Whitehead  would  have  us  restructure  our  conception  of  how  nature  is  organized  to  consider 
both  the  private  and  public  aspects  equally.  In  his  view  reality  can  be  analyzed  according  to 
genetic division and coordinate division, where the genetic division refers to the character 
of an actual occasion in concrescent immediacy, and coordinate division refers to its character 
as a concrete object.  The two sides of reality, genetic and coordinate,  reflect the private and 
public duality of existence, respectively; they are combined them into one and the same unit, the 
actual occasion. Each occasion breathes in an inspiration of feeling during its genetic, dative 
phase  and  exhales  during  its  coordinate,  objectification  phase  to  reach  what  Whitehead  calls 
satisfaction. In this inward prehension of data and outward expression into objectification, the 
entity  comes  into  existence  in  a  process  comparable  to  the  common,  biological  process  of  a 
living organism.  

Whiteheads  understanding  of  life  has  contributed  key  concepts  to  biology  for  a  more 
fundamental  understanding  of  biological  form  as  it  occurs  in  living  actuality.  He  heavily 
emphasized  the  importance  of  time  in  existence,  and  therefore  the  nature  of  process  to  all 
things:  nothing  is  alive  without  time.  His  further  puts  emphasis  on  feeling  as  fundamental  to 
process,  and  the  concrete  notion  of  a  private  and  public  aspect  to  all  things  points  toward  an 
understanding  of  biological  systems  as  perceptive,  active,  and  self-determining.  Whiteheads 
writing  can  inspire  and  clearly  reminds  us  that  perhaps  we  are  missing  something  more  of 
what we know life is, especially as we become engrained in an industry viewing life merely as a 
form of reactive biochemical mechanism. The facts of nature are the actualities; and the facts 
into  which  the  actualities  are  divisible  are  their  prehensions,  with  their  public  origins,  their 

private forms, and their private aims (PR 290 [444]).

1  The  term  biology  is  taken  from  bios  and  logos,  the  Greek  for  life  and  reasoned  account, 

respectively. 

2  In  this  chapter,  I  refer  specifically  to  mainstream,  research-based  biology  that  is  taught  and 
practiced  in  the  major universities and research  institutions. I do  this because  it  is  this body of 
knowledge that is the authoritative form and the one that directly informs the public.

Title: Sports Participation and Social Personality Variable of Students, PDF: Research_papers_50\EJ1079972.pdf
Header: ABSTRACT 
The main thrust of this study was to investigate sports participation and social personality variable of students in 
secondary  schools  in  Central  Senatorial  District  of  Cross  River  State,  Nigeria.    To  achieve  the  purpose  of  this 
study,  one  hypothesis  was  formulated  to  guide  the  study.  Literature  review  was  carried  out  according  to  the 
variable  of  the  study.  Survey  research  design  was  adopted  for  the  study.  A  sample  of  five  hundred  (500) 
respondents  was  randomly  selected  for  the  study.  The  selection  was  done  through  the  simple  random  sampling 
technique. The questionnaire was the instrument used for data collection. The reliability estimate of the instrument 
was established through the Cronbach Alpha reliability method. Independent t-test analysis was employed to test 
the  hypothesis  under  study.  The  hypothesis  was  tested  at  .05  level  of  significance.  The  result  of  the  analysis 
revealed that, there is a significant difference in the physical variablesof secondary school students who participate 
and those who do not participate in sports. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that students 
should endeavour to take home the crusade of sports participation to further foster their interpersonal relationship 
with  others  around  their  neighbourhood  and  community  and  again,  the  physical  education  teachers  who  are  the 
custodians of sports in these schools, should make sure that every student takes active part in sports during training 
sessions.

Header: Introduction  
Sports  are  biological  cum  motor  activities  which  enable  an  individual  to  develop  and  control  his 
physique.  It  can  also  be  described  as  activities  involving  physical  exertion  and  skill  in  which  an  individual  or 
team competes against another or for the purpose of entertainment. Nevertheless, the traditional view of sports 
participation is that, it has a beneficial effect on the social and moral development of children and young people. 
Sports  may  have  the  tendency  if  well  organised  to  change  the  entire  human  personality  (whole-man)  through 
active and passive participation. Such components of personality that sports are capable of transforming include: 
physical, social, moral, mental, and emotional (Agbomi, 2012). 

According  to  Edim  (2011),  sports  can  be  termed  as  well  organized  and  institutionalized  physical 
activities with structured programmes governed with rules and regulations. He further stressed that a good sports 
programme must be geared towards developing a whole-man which is developing physically, socially skilfully, 
mentally,  emotionally  and  morally  individual  (which  is  otherwise  known  as  personality  development)  that  is 
acceptable in the community and with good health. 

Edim, Emeribe and Akah (2008), expressed that it is not an overstatement to remark that of all school 
subjects  put  together,  sports  alone  can  take  a  very  prominent  position  in  the  educational  system.  Sports  if 
properly  harnessed,  can  contribute  about  fifty  percent  (50%)  or  more  to  the  educational  goals  of  the  society. 
They said, it is a well known fact that sports and recreation have been fundamental elements of the curricular of 
institutions throughout history. According to anthropological and historical researchers, physical education and 
sports are the most ancient subjects in humanities. From early to the present time, sports in one form or the other 
has been promoted by all fields of world civilization. It has received varying degrees of cultural and government 
emphasis and attention (Oyeniyi, 2001). 

According  to  Edim  (2008),  one  of  the  psychological  constructs  that  lack  precise  and  universally 
accepted  definition  is  the  term  personality.  Its  problem  of  definition  stems  from  two  major  factors.  The  first 
factor could be traced to diverse theoretical orientations of scholars of the concept who have put forward these 
definitions. This situation gives room to multiplicity or irreconcilable definitions. The second factor is related to 
the etymology of the word personality. 

Hans  (1999)  defined  personality  as  the  more  or  less  stable  and  enduring  organisation  of  a  persons 
character, temperament, intellect, and physique which determines his unique adjustment to the environment.For 
the  purpose  of  this  research  work,  the  researcher  would  consider  the  concept  of  personality  as  it  concerns 
everything about an individual which include; the physical, social, mental, moral and emotional individual, and 
how these aforementioned components of personality have been improved upon through participation in sports.

Sports participation and social personality variable of students 

Leon (2006), opined that Sports for Social Development is a method of bringing about social changes 
through the use of sports. Most organizations utilizing this method are geared towards underprivileged children 
and teenagers in urban areas. The programs use sports to help children learn lifelong skills and as incentive for 
the  children  to  improve  their  scholarship.  The  Sports  for  Development  and  Peace  movement  recognizes  over 
700 organizations working towards the goal of social change. 

Sports  as  a  universal  language  can  be  a  powerful  vehicle  to  promote  peace,  tolerance  and 
understanding  by  bringing  people  together  across  boundaries,  culture  and  religions.  Government  and 
international  agencies  are  increasingly  recognizing  sports  as  an  important  powerful  and  unexploited  tool  for 
development in post-conflict reconstruction. In integrated programmes, sports can be used to attract young boys 
and  girls  away  from  the  streets.  Sport  is  an  excellent  "Training  Ground  for  Democracy"  and  for  promoting 
collective  action.  Its  value  also  lies  in  drawing  attention  to  the  plight  of  refugees  and  internally  displaced 
persons, helping to eliminate discrimination and stereotypes. Sport is an important component of culture. People 
express themselves and celebrate their communities through traditional sports and games. People share stoffes, 
myths, and lessons derived from sport. Through sport people learn values and behaviours that are applied to all 
aspects of society - hard work, discipline, the value of fun, teamwork, respect for others, and fair play (Hill & 
Hansen, 2008). 

Traditional games can be a prolific melting pot for people, groups and diverse communities belonging 
to different linguistic, religious and social backgrounds. These games can reflect diversity and cultural identities 
which can help bring people together and reduce prejudices. Their contribution to dialogue and fusion remains 
an asset within the framework of a culture of peace. People in every community across the continents follow 
teams and individuals from the local level to the world stage. Africans relax together over sport and it is often a 
shared topic of common interest. 

Research  also  indicates  that  sports  experiences  foster  citizenship,  social  success,  positive  peer 
relationships,  and  leadership  skills  (Evans  &  Roberts,  2007).  Youth  sports  and  physical  activity  participation 
has been positively correlated with adult career achievement (Larson &Verma, 2009) and negatively correlated 
with school dropout and delinquent behaviour (Segrave, 2009). Wankel (2010) highlighted that through sports, 
youth have opportunities to experience positive inter-group relations, community integration, social status, and 
social  mobility,  while  Cote  (2002)  suggests  that  sport  provides  an  arena  for  the  development  of  social  skills 
such  as  cooperation,  assertion,  responsibility,  empathy,  and  self-control.  Youth  involved  in  sport  often 
demonstrate  discipline  and  commitment  (Scanlan,  2011)  preliminary  evidence  suggests  that  these  traits  carry 
over into other domains of life such as school and community (Carpenter, 2001).

Header: Methodology 
The research design that was used in this study is Survey design. The population of the study was three 
thousand four hundred and seven (3407) senior secondary school students from the Central Senatorial District of 
Cross River State, Nigeria. The simple random sampling technique was used to select 500 senior students for the 
study. 

The  research  instrument  used  was  the  structured  questionnaire,  comprised  of  16  items,  all  on  a  four 
Likert scale. In term of validity, some experts in measurement and evaluation and Human Kinetics and Health 
Education affirmed with 90% agreement that the entire instrument was suited for measuring what it purported to 
measure using the Cronbach Alpha reliability test. The reliability index of the entire instrument was found to be 
0.86. face-to-face hand delivery was method was used during the data collection procedure. 

All the 500 copies of the questionnaire were retrieved and thus giving 100% return rate. The following 

hypothesis was tested in the study. 

  There is no significant difference in the social variables of students who participate in sports 

and those who do not participate.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: Result of the Hypothesis 
This hypothesis states that there is no significant difference in the social variable of secondary schools 
students who participate in sports and those who do not participate. 
The  dependent  variable  involved  in  this 
hypothesis is social variable, while the independent variable is sports participation which is categorized into two 
(those who participate and those who do not participate). Independent t-test analysis was employed to test this 
hypothesis. The result of the analysis is presented in Table 1.

of  1.96  at  .05  level  of  significance  with  498  degrees  of  freedom.  With  this  result  the  null  hypotheses  was 
rejected. This implies that there is a significant difference in social variable of secondary  school students  who 
participate in sports and those who do not. 
Discussion of findings 

The  result  of  this  hypothesis  indicated  that  there  is  a  significant  difference  in  the  social  variables  of 
secondary  school  students  who  participate  in  sports  and  those  who  do  not  participate.  The  findings  of  this 
hypothesis is in agreement with the view of Leon (2006), who opined that Sports for Social Development is a 
method of bringing about social changes through the use of sports. Most organizations utilizing this method are 
geared towards underprivileged children and teenagers in urban areas. The programs use sports to help children 
learn lifelong skills and as incentive for the children to improve their scholarship. The Sports for Development 
and Peace movement recognizes over 700 organizations working towards the goal of social change. 

Hill & Hansen (2008) also maintained that sports as a universal language can be a powerful vehicle to 
promote  peace,  tolerance  and  understanding  by  bringing  people  together  across  boundaries,  culture  and 
religions. Government and international agencies are increasingly recognizing sports as an important powerful 
and unexploited tool for development in post-conflict reconstruction. In integrated programmes, sports can be

and  internally  displaced  persons,  helping  to  eliminate  discrimination  and  stereotypes.  Sport  is  an  important

cooperation,  assertion,  responsibility,  empathy,  and  self-control.  Youth  involved  in  sport  often  demonstrate 
discipline and commitment. Preliminary evidence suggests that these traits carry over into other domains of life 
such  as  school  and  community.  He  also  proposes  that  initiative,  a  key  component  to  youths'  positive  social 
development,  can  also  be  developed  through  these  structured  activities.  Given  today's  job  demands  and  basic 
lifestyle  requirements,  Larson  (2000)  also  argues  that  youth  need  to  take  charge  of  their  lives  through  the 
development of initiative. Larson believes that initiative is constructed of three  

key elements (intrinsic motivation, concerted engagement, and temporal effort directed towards a goal) 
and suggests that structured voluntary activities such as sports, arts, music, hobbies, and organizations offer the 
best  contexts  for  initiative  development,  as  they  are  voluntary  (require  youth  to  be  intrinsically  motivated), 
require attention (elements of challenge), and require effort over time. He distinguishes how structured leisure 
activities  such  as  sport  (which  requires  attention  and  effort  over  time,  and  is  voluntary),  differs  from  school 
(which requires attention and effort over time, but is not voluntary), and television viewing (which is voluntary, 
but does not require attention or effort over time). 

The increasing competitiveness in youth sports settings, coupled with the physical nature of sports, has 

led youth sports involvement to be linked to numerous negative social outcomes.

Header: Conclusion and Recommendations 
Based on the result of the study the following conclusion was reached. There is a significant difference 
in the social variables of secondary school students who participate in sports and those who do not participate. 
Some recommendations were made: 

  Students should endeavour to take home the crusade of sports participation to further foster their 

interpersonal relationship with others around their neighbourhood and community. 

  The physical education teachers who are the custodians of sports in these schools, should make 

sure that every student takes active part in sports during training sessions. 

  A more regular inter-school sport competition programmes should be encouraged by the 

government to foster students unity.

educational research. It is important for English language teachers to understand the underlying ontological and 
epistemological assumptions behind each piece of research that they read. Teachers need to be able to recognize 
how these assumptions relate to the researchers chosen methodology and methods, and how these assumptions 
connect  to  the  findings  which  are  presented  in  journal  articles.  This  understanding  will  enable  improved: 
comprehension  of  research,  application  of  theory  to  classroom  practice,  engagement  in  academic  debate,  and 
presentation of their own research findings. This paper gives an overview of what a paradigm consists of, and 
then explores and discusses the assumptions behind the scientific, interpretive, and critical paradigms. 

2. What Is a Paradigm? 

A  paradigm  consists  of  the  following  components:  ontology,  epistemology,  methodology,  and,  methods.  Each 
component is explained, and then the relationships between them are explored. 

Ontology  is  the  study  of  being  (Crotty,  1998,  p.  10).  Ontological  assumptions  are  concerned  with  what 
constitutes reality, in other words what is. Researchers need to take a position regarding their perceptions of how 
things really are and how things really work. 

Epistemology is concerned with the nature and forms of knowledge (Cohen et al., 2007, p. 7). Epistemological 
assumptions  are  concerned  with  how  knowledge  can  be  created,  acquired  and  communicated,  in  other  words 
what it means to know. Guba and Lincon (1994, p. 108) explain that epistemology asks the question, what is the 
nature of the relationship between the would-be knower and what can be known? 

Every paradigm is based upon its own ontological and epistemological assumptions. Since all assumptions are 
conjecture,  the  philosophical  underpinnings  of  each  paradigm  can  never  be  empirically  proven  or  disproven. 
Different  paradigms  inherently  contain  differing  ontological  and  epistemological  views;  therefore,  they  have 
differing  assumptions  of  reality  and  knowledge  which  underpin  their  particular  research  approach.  This  is 
reflected in their methodology and methods. 

Methodology is the strategy or plan of action which lies behind the choice and use of particular methods (Crotty, 
1998. p. 3). Thus, methodology is concerned with why, what, from where, when and how data is collected and 
analyzed. Guba and Lincon (1994, p. 108) explain that methodology asks the question: how can the inquirer go 
about finding out whatever they believe can be known? 

Methods  are  the  specific  techniques  and  procedures  used to  collect  and  analyze  data  (Crotty,  1998,  p.  3).  The

data collected will either be qualitative or quantitative. All paradigms can use both quantitative and qualitative 
data.   

Research methods can be traced back, through methodology and epistemology, to an ontological position.    It is 
impossible  to  engage  in  any  form  of  research  without  committing  (often  implicitly)  to  ontological  and 
epistemological positions. Researchers differing ontological and epistemological positions often lead to different 
research  approaches  towards  the  same  phenomenon  (Grix,  2004,  p.  64).  This  will  become  evident  as  the 
scientific, interpretive, and critical paradigms are explored.

Header: 3. Explanation of the Scientific Paradigm   
The  scientific  paradigm  rose  to  prominence  during  the  Enlightenment.  Comte  popularized  the  term  positivism 
(Crotty,  1998,  p.  19)  when  he  sought  to  apply  the  scientific  paradigm,  which  originated  studying  the  natural 
world, to the social world (Cohen et al., p. 9). 

The  ontological  position  of  positivism  is  one  of  realism.  Realism  is  the  view  that  objects  have  an  existence 
independent  of  the  knower  (Cohen  et  al.,  2007,  p.  7).  Thus,  a  discoverable  reality  exists  independently  of  the 
researcher (Pring,  2000a,  p. 59).  Most  positivists  assume  that  reality  is  not  mediated  by  our  senses.  Language 
fulfills a representational role as it is connected to the world by some designative function; consequently, words 
owe their meaning to the objects which they name or designate (Frowe, 2001, p. 176).   

The  positivist  epistemology  is  one  of  objectivism.  Positivists  go  forth  into  the  world  impartially,  discovering 
absolute  knowledge  about  an  objective  reality.  The  researcher  and  the  researched  are  independent  entities. 
Meaning solely resides in objects, not in the conscience of the researcher, and it is the aim of the researcher to 
obtain this meaning. Crotty (1998, p. 8) elaborates, 

A tree in the forest is a tree, regardless of whether anyone is aware of whether anyone is aware of its existence 
or not. As an object of that kind, it carries the intrinsic meaning of treeness. When human beings recognize it as 
a tree, they are simply discovering a meaning that has been lying in wait for them all along. 

Thus, phenomena have an independent existence which can be discovered via research. Positivistic statements 
are descriptive and factual. The scientific paradigm is foundational as scientific propositions are founded on data 
and facts (House, 1991, p. 2). This discoverable knowledge is considered to be absolute and value free; it is not 
situated in a political or historic context. 
During  the  20th  century,  post-positivism  emerged  from  positivism.  Post-positivism  has  similar  ontological  and 
epistemological  beliefs  as  positivism;  however,  it  differs  in  several  ways.  Firstly,  the  truth  produced  by  the 
scientific  paradigm  is  simply  our  belief  in  the  truth  of  current  tested  hypotheses  (Popper,  1959,  p.  415-9). 
Secondly, the principle of falsification argues that scientific theories can never be proven true (Ernest, 1994, p. 
22). Only when all attempts to refute them fail can they tentatively be accepted. Thus, every scientific statement 
must  remain  tentative  forever  (Popper,  1959, p. 280). Finally,  in order  to understand  some  scientific  theories 
more than empirical data is needed. For example, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to 
know  both  the  exact  position  and  velocity  of  a  subatomic  particle  at  the  same  time  (Crotty,  1998,  p.  29). 
Post-positivism  claims  that  post-positivistic  knowledge  is  more  certain  and  objective  than  knowledge  which 
originated from other paradigms. 

Positivist  methodology  is  directed  at  explaining  relationships.  Positivists  attempt  to  identify  causes  which 
influence outcomes (Creswell, 2009, p. 7). Their aim is to formulate laws, thus yielding a basis for prediction 
and  generalization.  A  deductive  approach  is  undertaken.  Correlation  and  experimentation  are  used  to  reduce 
complex  interactions  their  constituent  parts.  Verifiable  evidence  sought  via  direct  experience  and  observation; 
this  often  involves  empirical  testing,  random  samples,  controlled  variables  (independent,  dependent  and 
moderator) and control groups. True-experiments are preferred over quasi-experiments. Cohen et al. (2007, p. 8) 
identifies  that  an  approach  which  is  characterized  by  procedure  and  methods  which  are  designed  to  discover 
general laws is nomothetic. Positivists view their methodology as value neutral, thus the knowledge generated is 
value neutral.   

Similarly, post-positivists seek to understand causal relationships; thus, experimentation and correlational studies 
are used. However more than sense-data is collected, participants perspectives are often sought. Furthermore, as 
knowledge is tentative, hypotheses are not proved but simply not rejected (Creswell, 2009, p. 7).   

The  scientific  paradigm  seeks  predictions  and  generalizations;  thus,  methods  often  generate  quantitative  data. 
Examples  include:  standardized  tests,  closed  ended  questionnaires  and  descriptions  of  phenomena  using 
standardized  observation  tools  (Pring,  2000a,  p.  34).  Analysis  involves  descriptive  and  inferential  statistics. 
Inferential statistics allow sample results to be generalized to populations.

Research  is  deemed  good  if  its  results  are  due  to  the  independent  variable  (internal  validity),  can  be 
generalized/transferred to other populations or situations (external validity), and different researchers can record 
the same data in the same way and arrive at the same conclusions (replicable and reliable). Additionally, research 
needs to be as objective as possible and robust to empirical refutation.

Header: 4. Discussion of the Scientific Paradigm   
Since methods developed to understand the natural world are not always directly transferable to the social world, 
positivism has limitations. 

Although positivism attempts to reduce the complex to the simple by simplifying and controlling variables, this 
is extremely difficult to do in educational research. Often context limits methodology; isolating variables can be 
difficult.  For  example,  project  Follow  Through  (Abt  Associates,  1977)  investigated  20  teaching  models  and 
involved 20,000 children. Many of the null hypotheses in this study could not be rejected because many of the 
treatments did not consider all contextual variables (Kennedy, 1978, p. 8-9). 

Some  variables  may  be  hidden  from  the  researcher  and  only  become  known  when  their  effects  are  evident 
(House,  1991,  p.  6).  Examples  of  fluctuating  individual  factors  include:  ordinary  life  events  (headaches)  and 
attitudes (enthusiasm). Therefore, predictions could be correct due to random reasons (Shank & Brown, 2007, p. 
28). No scientific explanation of human behavior is ever complete (Berliner, 2002, p. 20). 

Inferential statistical tests are often misused and their results are often misinterpreted. Researchers may select an 
incorrect statistical test. For example, if data is not distributed normally, then a non-parametric test is required. 
Furthermore,  the  interpretation of  P-values  is dependent on whether  you  are  hypothesis  testing or  significance 
testing, and the results of tests of statistical significance are dependent upon sample size (Blume & Peipert, 2003, 
p. 2-4). Thus, the results of inferential statistical tests cannot be taken at face-value. 

Deduction  from  empirical  generalization  is  rarely  explanatory  (Scriven,  1970,  p.  100-101).  Positivistic 
generalizations  ignore  the  intentionality  of  the  individual,  thus  actions  are  not  fully  understood.  Two  students 
who may appear to be doing the same thing could be doing different things. For example, two students write the 
answer  to  2x7.  Student  A  memorized  the  answer,  student  B  added  seven  together  twice.  Actions  need  to  be 
understood from the participants perspectives, including both process and agency. 

Positivists self-delude themselves into thinking that their research is value free. Firstly, throughout the research 
process researchers make value-laden judgments, for example: selection of variables, actions to be observed, and 
interpretation of findings (Salomon, 1991, p. 10-18). Secondly, knowledge production is political. Refusing to 
consider the political connections of produced knowledge is in itself political. 

Positivists  have  contributed  to  understanding  philosophy,  adopted  high  standards  of  rigor  and  attempted  to 
formulate  methods  which  yield  commonly  accepted  results  (Ashby,  1964,  p.  508).  Verified  observation 
statements, which are of use to policy makers, have been produced, for example evidence about the long-term 
positive  effects  of  small  class  size.  Although  certainty  is  elusive,  aspects  of  positivism  belong  in  educational 
research.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 5. Explanation of the Interpretive Paradigm 
The  ontological  position  of  interpretivism  is  relativism.  Relativism  is  the  view  that  reality  is  subjective  and 
differs from person to person (Guba & Lincoln, 1994, p. 110). Our realties are mediated by our senses. Without 
consciousness  the  world  is  meaningless.  Reality  emerges  when  consciousness  engages  with  objects  which  are 
already  pregnant  with  meaning  (Crotty,  1998,  p.  43).  Reality  is  individually  constructed;  there  are  as  many 
realities as individuals. Language does not passively label objects but actively shapes and moulds reality (Frowe, 
2001,  p.  185).  Thus,  reality  is  constructed  through  the  interaction  between  language  and  aspects  of  an 
independent world. 

The interpretive epistemology is one of subjectivism which is based on real world phenomena. The world does 
not  exist  independently  of  our  knowledge  of  it  (Grix,  2004,  p.  83).  Regarding  trees,  Crotty  (1998,  p.  43) 
elaborates, 

We need to remind ourselves here that it is human beings who have constructed it as a tree, given it the name, 
and attributed to it the associations we make with trees. 

A  tree  is  not  a  tree  without  someone  to  call  it  a  tree.  Meaning  is  not  discovered;  it  is  constructed  though  the 
interaction between consciousness and the world. Consciousness is always consciousness of something (Crotty, 
1998, p. 44). To experience a world is to participate in it, simultaneously molding and encountering it (Heron & 
Reason, 1997, p. 3). Intentionality refers to the interaction between consciousness and phenomena.

Regarding the same phenomenon, different people may construct meaning in different ways (Crotty, 1998, p. 9) 
but truth is a consensus formed by co-constructors (Pring, 2000b, p. 251). Therefore, knowledge has the trait of 
being  culturally  derived  and  historically  situated.  The  interpretive  paradigm  does  not  question  ideologies;  it 
accepts them.     

Knowledge and meaningful reality are constructed in and out of interaction between humans and their world and 
are developed and transmitted in a social context (Crotty, 1998, p. 42). Therefore, the social world can only be 
understood  from  the  standpoint  of  individuals  who  are  participating  in  it  (Cohen  et  al.,  2007,  p.  19). 
Interpretivism aims to bring into consciousness hidden social forces and structures. 

Interpretive  methodology  is  directed  at  understanding  phenomenon  from  an  individuals  perspective, 
investigating interaction among individuals as well as the historical and cultural contexts which people inhabit 
(Creswell,  2009,  p.  8).  Examples  of  methodology  include:  case  studies  (in-depth  study  of  events  or  processes 
over  a  prolonged  period),  phenomenology  (the  study  of  direct  experience  without  allowing  the  interference  of 
existing preconceptions), hermeneutics (deriving hidden meaning from language), and ethnography (the study of 
cultural groups over a prolonged period). 

Individual constructs are elicited and understood through interaction between researchers and participants (Guba 
& Lincon, 1994, p. 111) with participants being relied on as much as possible (Creswell, 2009, p. 8). Events are 
not reduced to simplistic interpretations; new layers of understanding are uncovered as phenomena are thickly 
described.  Interpretive  theory  is  usually  grounded  (inductive),  being  generated  from  the  data,  not  preceding  it 
(Cohen et al., 2007, p. 22). Thus, research questions are broad. Cohen et al. (2007, p. 8) identify that an approach 
characterized  by  its  emphasis  on  an  individual  case,  in  which  a  relativistic  social  world  is  embedded,  is 
idiographic.  Interpretivists  acknowledge  that  value  free  knowledge  is  not  possible.  For  example,  researchers 
assert their beliefs when they choose what to research, how to research and how to interpret their data (Edge & 
Richards, 1998, p. 336). 

Interpretive  methods  yield  insight  and  understandings  of  behavior,  explain  actions  from  the  participants 
perspective,  and  do  not  dominate  the  participants.  Examples  include:  open-ended  interviews,  focus  groups, 
open-ended  questionnaires,  open-ended  observations,  think  aloud  protocol  and  role-playing.  These  methods 
usually generate qualitative data. Analyses are the researchers interpretations; consequently, researchers need to 
make their agenda and value- system explicit from the outset. 

Research  is  deemed  good  if  it:  provides  rich  evidence  and  offers  credible  and  justifiable  accounts  (internal 
validity/credibility), can be made use of by someone in another situation (external validity/transferability), and 
the research process and findings can be replicated (reliability/dependability) (Richie & Lewis, 2003, p. 263-286; 
Cohen et al, 2007, p. 133-149).

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 6. Discussion of the Interpretive Paradigm 
Although  the  interpretive  paradigm  is  sensitive  to  individual  meanings  that  can  become  buried  within  broader 
generalizations (Samdahl, 1999, p. 119), it has shortcomings. 

Interpretive  research  rejects  a  foundational  base  to  knowledge,  bringing  into  question  its  validity.  Interpretive 
research  cannot  be  judged  using  the  same  criteria  as  the  scientific  paradigm.  Legitimacy  and  trustworthiness 
need  to be  achieved  without claiming uncontested  certainty.  However,  reaching a  consensus  is problematic.  If 
reality is subjective and differs from person to person, then research participants cannot be expected to arrive at 
exactly the same interpretations as researchers (Rolfe, 2006, p. 305). Therefore, validity adding criteria such as 
triangulation, member checking and peer review are ineffective as they assume an underlying objective reality 
which can be converged upon (Angen, 2000, p. 384).     

Knowledge produced by the interpretive paradigm has limited transferability as it is usually fragmented and not 
unified into a coherent body. Generalizations which are deemed useful to policy makers are often absent because 
its  research  usually  produces  highly  contextualized  qualitative  data,  and  interpretations  of  this  data  involve 
subjective individual constructions. Consequently, policy makers are often reluctant to fund interpretive research, 
for example, the US No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 predominately promoted research based on the scientific 
paradigm (Berliner, 2002, p. 18-20).   

Participants  autonomy  and  privacy  can  be  compromised  as  the  methods  of  interpretive  research  are  more 
intimate  and  open-ended  than  scientific  research.  Intimacy  and  open-endedness  may  facilitate  the  unintended 
discovery of secrets, lies and oppressive relationships (Howe & Moses, 1999, p. 40). Researchers may have to 
decide if they have an ethical responsibility to reveal their participants or intervene in their lives, for example, 
protecting  students  from  abusive  teachers.  Additionally  the  more  information  that  researchers  give  when 

12

constructing a thick description, the greater the risk of participant exposure. Researchers may have to tone-down 
their contextualization in order to protect participants identities. 

Participants have limited control and are vulnerable to researchers imposing their own subjective interpretations 
upon  them.  Interpretive  researchers  produce  theorized  accounts  that  represent  participants  sociological 
understandings (Danby & Farrell, 2004, p. 41). This raises issues of: who owns the data, how will the data be 
used and how much control over the findings do participants have? Even though participants are often given a 
voice, it is usually the researcher who decides on: the direction that the research takes, the final interpretation of 
the data, and which information is made public. 

The pre-existing meaning making system which we are born into distorts our understanding of phenomena and 
we are unaware of this. Interpretive research often neglects external structural forces which influence behavior 
(Cohen  et  al.,  2007,  p.  26).  Understandings  are  structured  historically  in  the  traditions,  prejudices  and 
institutional practices that come down to us (Taylor, 1993, p. 59). Therefore, participants might not be aware of 
invisible  ideology  which  guides  their  actions.  As  participants  might  not  fully  understand  the  forces  which  are 
acting on their agency, their explanations of phenomena are incomplete.

Header: 7. Explanation of the Critical Paradigm 
The ontological position of the critical paradigm is historical realism. Historical realism is the view that reality 
has been shaped by social, political, cultural, economic, ethnic, and gender values; reality that was once deemed 
plastic has become crystallized (Guba & Lincon, 1994, p. 110). Realities are socially constructed entities that are 
under constant internal influence. 

Language does not passively label objects but actively shapes and moulds reality (Frowe, 2001, p. 185). Reality 
is  constructed  through  the  interaction  between  language  and  aspects  of  an  independent  world.  However,  the 
critical paradigm takes the view that language contains power relations so it is used to empower or weaken. 

Critical epistemology is one of subjectivism which is based on real world phenomena and linked with societal 
ideology. Knowledge is both socially constructed and influenced by power relations from within society. Cohen 
et al. (2009, p. 27) explain that, what counts as knowledge is determined by the social and positional power of 
the advocates of that knowledge. Regarding knowledge on trees, different organizations have differing beliefs. 
For  example,  the  World  Wildlife  Fund  and  logging  companies  have  differing  agendas;  therefore,  they  often 
dispute what constitutes an endangered tree. 

Social constructionism argues that we are born into a world in which meaning has already been made; we are 
born into culture. We come to inhabit a pre-existing system and to be inhabited by it, (Crotty, 1998, p. 53). 
This pre-existing system consists of consensuses about knowledge that have already been reached and are still 
being  reached.  Furthermore,  it  is  stratified  and  marked  with  inequality.  Research  interests  are  influenced  by 
culture, race, gender and location (Siegel, 2006, p. 5). Academic and scientific communities, which validate and 
legitimize knowledge claims, unwittingly contribute to systems of oppression. For example, much of the social 
and psychological  theory  which underpins the  scientific  paradigm  was  developed by  white,  able-bodied  males 
(Mertens, 2005, p. 17). As knowledge claims are always embedded in regimes of truth, consideration should be 
given to domination, exclusion, privilege and marginalization (Ceci et al., 2002, p. 714).     

The critical paradigm is anti-foundational; it attacks this reality. People are not only in the world but also with it 
(Crotty,  1998,  p.  149).  Reality  is  alterable  by  human  action.  The  critical  paradigm  seeks  to  address  issues  of 
social  justice  and  marginalism.  The  emancipatory  function  of  knowledge  is  embraced.  Different  theoretical 
perspectives of critical inquiry include: Marxism, queer theory and feminism. 

As it is culturally derived, historically situated and influenced by political ideology, knowledge is not value free. 
The critical paradigm asks the axiological question: what is intrinsically worthwhile? Thus, the critical paradigm 
is  normative;  it  considers  how  things  ought  to  be;  it  judges  reality.  The  utopian  aspirations  of  the  critical 
paradigm may never be realized but a more democratic society may materialize. 

Critical  methodology  is  directed  at  interrogating  values  and  assumptions,  exposing  hegemony  and  injustice, 
challenging  conventional  social  structures  and  engaging  in  social  action  (Crotty,  1998,  p.  157).  Inquiry  is 
inseparable from politics. Its aim is to emancipate the disempowered. Researchers embrace their ideology as they 
recognize that no research methodology is value free (Pring, 2000b, p. 250). Therefore, the starting point of a 
critical researcher is often preconceived. Finding out is the means, change is the underlying aim. This involves 
making  people  critically  aware  of  their  situation  (conscientization),  then  realizing  change  through  a  praxis, 
which  is  repeated  action  informed  by  reflection  (Freire,  1970,  p.  48).  Thus,  there  is  an  emergent,  recursive 
relationship between theory, data, research questions and interpretation (Talmy, 2010, p. 130).

Participants and researchers are both subjects in the dialectical task of unveiling reality, critically analyzing it, 
and recreating that knowledge (Freire, 1970, p. 51). Researchers do not carry out transformation for participants 
but with them (Freire, 1970, p. 49). Consequently, participants are involved in the research process, for example 
designing questions, collecting data, analyzing information and benefiting from research (Creswell, 2009, p. 9). 
Critical  methodologies  include:  critical  discourse  analysis  (examines  how  social  and  political  domination  is 
realized  in  text  and  talk),  critical  ethnography  (an  ideologically  sensitive  orientation  to  the  study  of  culture 
(Canagarajah, 1993, p. 605)), action research (a cyclical process of investigation, action and evaluation which 
results in a change in practice), and ideology critique (exposes hidden ideology by revealing participants places 
in systems which empower or disempower them.) 

Critical  methods  enable  realities  to  be  critically  examined  from  a  cultural,  historical  and  political  stance. 
Examples  include:  open-ended  interviews,  focus  groups,  open-ended  questionnaires,  open-ended  observations, 
and journals. These methods usually generate qualitative data. Similar to interpretivism, analysis often involves 
thematic interpretation of data; however, explicit values are now placed on these interpretations. 

Critical  research  should  fully  acknowledge  its  context  (culturally,  historically  and  politically)  and  promote 
dialogical  relations of  equality  between  the researchers  and  participants. Additionally,  research  must  create  an 
agenda for change or reform, enhancing the lives of the participants. It must have catalytic validity (Cohen et al., 
2007, p. 139).

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 8. Discussion of the Critical Paradigm 
The critical paradigm exposes how political ideology is inextricably interwoven with knowledge, but problems 
exist.   

Critical  research  has  an  agenda  of  change;  therefore,  it  is  often  not  supported  by  existing  regimes.  Giroux 
(Giroux,  2011)  argues  that  neoliberal  and  neoconservative  forces  are  currently  transforming  American 
universities into anti-democratic public spheres; consequently, the right of faculty to work in an autonomous and 
critical fashion is under attack. One way to control research is through funding, for example the US No Child 
Left  Behind  Act  (Berliner, 2002,  p.  18-20).  Knowledge production  is  influenced  by politics.  Often  the  critical 
paradigm is not favored by existing policy makers. 

A dialogue of equals is virtually impossible as power differentials between researchers and participants exist. For 
example,  action  research  carried  out  in  secondary  schools  might  encounter  the  following  problems.  Teachers 
control  the  research  agenda,  thus  participants  may  not  be  involved  in  the  research  design.  A  high  degree  of 
obligation will exist for students to participate; it would be difficult for a student to refuse a teacher on whom 
they are dependent for grades and access to resources (Nolen & Putten, 2007, p. 402). If participants try to please 
the researcher, the data given may not be accurate and the research findings may not be credible. Consequently, 
issues of collaboration, consent, coerciveness, and autonomy must be considered. 

Emancipation is not guaranteed. The change in the participants lives may be negligible or non-existent. Does 
the  majority  of  action  research  make  an  emancipatory  difference?  There  is  little  evidence  to  suggest  so. 
Furthermore,  once  participants  become  critically  aware  of  their  situation,  change  may  not  be  possible. 
Despondency  may  ensue  as  blissful  ignorance  is  shattered.  Alternatively,  some  participants  lives  may  be 
changed  for  the  worst.  For  example,  Rushton,  a  Canadian  psychologist,  attempted  rationalize  racist  policy  by 
linking race to intelligence and moral behavior (Howe, 2009, p. 436). 

The critical paradigm stereotypes participants in two ways. Firstly, it often labels participants as belonging to a 
particular  marginalized  group;  therefore,  homogeneous  notions  of  identity  are  superimposed.  Secondly,  the 
critical  paradigm  does  not  acknowledge  that  different  participants  enter  the  research  with  varying  levels  of 
conscientization.  It  naively  assumes  that  populations  blindly  do  the  bidding  of  powerful  regimes,  further 
enslaving themselves in the process.   

Most of the leading authors in the critical paradigm have been male, prompting feminists to criticize the critical 
paradigm as excluding the voices and concerns of marginalized groups (Burbules & Berk, 1999). Ironically, the 
critical pedagogy can be accused of maintaining societal status-quos.

What  knowledge  is,  and  ways  of  discovering  it,  are  subjective.  Regarding  educational  research,  the  scientific 
paradigm seeks to generalize, the interpretive paradigm seeks to understand, and the critical paradigm seeks to 
emancipate. Each paradigm has its own ways of realizing its aims. Understanding the philosophical assumptions 
that underpin each paradigm and how these assumptions manifest themselves within methodology and methods 
will enable English language teachers to better comprehend, question, and apply the research that they read.

Header: 1. Introduction 
What  knowledge  is,  and  the  ways  of  discovering  it,  are  subjective.  This  paper  explores  the  subjectivity  of 
educational research. It is important for English language teachers to understand the underlying ontological and 
epistemological assumptions behind each piece of research that they read. Teachers need to be able to recognize 
how these assumptions relate to the researchers chosen methodology and methods, and how these assumptions 
connect  to  the  findings  which  are  presented  in  journal  articles.  This  understanding  will  enable  improved: 
comprehension  of  research,  application  of  theory  to  classroom  practice,  engagement  in  academic  debate,  and 
presentation of their own research findings. This paper gives an overview of what a paradigm consists of, and 
then explores and discusses the assumptions behind the scientific, interpretive, and critical paradigms. 

2. What Is a Paradigm? 

A  paradigm  consists  of  the  following  components:  ontology,  epistemology,  methodology,  and,  methods.  Each 
component is explained, and then the relationships between them are explored. 

Ontology  is  the  study  of  being  (Crotty,  1998,  p.  10).  Ontological  assumptions  are  concerned  with  what 
constitutes reality, in other words what is. Researchers need to take a position regarding their perceptions of how 
things really are and how things really work. 

Epistemology is concerned with the nature and forms of knowledge (Cohen et al., 2007, p. 7). Epistemological 
assumptions  are  concerned  with  how  knowledge  can  be  created,  acquired  and  communicated,  in  other  words 
what it means to know. Guba and Lincon (1994, p. 108) explain that epistemology asks the question, what is the 
nature of the relationship between the would-be knower and what can be known? 

Every paradigm is based upon its own ontological and epistemological assumptions. Since all assumptions are 
conjecture,  the  philosophical  underpinnings  of  each  paradigm  can  never  be  empirically  proven  or  disproven. 
Different  paradigms  inherently  contain  differing  ontological  and  epistemological  views;  therefore,  they  have 
differing  assumptions  of  reality  and  knowledge  which  underpin  their  particular  research  approach.  This  is 
reflected in their methodology and methods. 

Methodology is the strategy or plan of action which lies behind the choice and use of particular methods (Crotty, 
1998. p. 3). Thus, methodology is concerned with why, what, from where, when and how data is collected and 
analyzed. Guba and Lincon (1994, p. 108) explain that methodology asks the question: how can the inquirer go 
about finding out whatever they believe can be known? 

Methods  are  the  specific  techniques  and  procedures  used to  collect  and  analyze  data  (Crotty,  1998,  p.  3).  The

data collected will either be qualitative or quantitative. All paradigms can use both quantitative and qualitative 
data.   

Research methods can be traced back, through methodology and epistemology, to an ontological position.    It is 
impossible  to  engage  in  any  form  of  research  without  committing  (often  implicitly)  to  ontological  and 
epistemological positions. Researchers differing ontological and epistemological positions often lead to different 
research  approaches  towards  the  same  phenomenon  (Grix,  2004,  p.  64).  This  will  become  evident  as  the 
scientific, interpretive, and critical paradigms are explored.

Header: 3. Explanation of the Scientific Paradigm   
The  scientific  paradigm  rose  to  prominence  during  the  Enlightenment.  Comte  popularized  the  term  positivism 
(Crotty,  1998,  p.  19)  when  he  sought  to  apply  the  scientific  paradigm,  which  originated  studying  the  natural 
world, to the social world (Cohen et al., p. 9). 

The  ontological  position  of  positivism  is  one  of  realism.  Realism  is  the  view  that  objects  have  an  existence 
independent  of  the  knower  (Cohen  et  al.,  2007,  p.  7).  Thus,  a  discoverable  reality  exists  independently  of  the 
researcher (Pring,  2000a,  p. 59).  Most  positivists  assume  that  reality  is  not  mediated  by  our  senses.  Language 
fulfills a representational role as it is connected to the world by some designative function; consequently, words 
owe their meaning to the objects which they name or designate (Frowe, 2001, p. 176).   

The  positivist  epistemology  is  one  of  objectivism.  Positivists  go  forth  into  the  world  impartially,  discovering 
absolute  knowledge  about  an  objective  reality.  The  researcher  and  the  researched  are  independent  entities. 
Meaning solely resides in objects, not in the conscience of the researcher, and it is the aim of the researcher to 
obtain this meaning. Crotty (1998, p. 8) elaborates, 

A tree in the forest is a tree, regardless of whether anyone is aware of whether anyone is aware of its existence 
or not. As an object of that kind, it carries the intrinsic meaning of treeness. When human beings recognize it as 
a tree, they are simply discovering a meaning that has been lying in wait for them all along. 

Thus, phenomena have an independent existence which can be discovered via research. Positivistic statements 
are descriptive and factual. The scientific paradigm is foundational as scientific propositions are founded on data 
and facts (House, 1991, p. 2). This discoverable knowledge is considered to be absolute and value free; it is not 
situated in a political or historic context. 
During  the  20th  century,  post-positivism  emerged  from  positivism.  Post-positivism  has  similar  ontological  and 
epistemological  beliefs  as  positivism;  however,  it  differs  in  several  ways.  Firstly,  the  truth  produced  by  the 
scientific  paradigm  is  simply  our  belief  in  the  truth  of  current  tested  hypotheses  (Popper,  1959,  p.  415-9). 
Secondly, the principle of falsification argues that scientific theories can never be proven true (Ernest, 1994, p. 
22). Only when all attempts to refute them fail can they tentatively be accepted. Thus, every scientific statement 
must  remain  tentative  forever  (Popper,  1959, p. 280). Finally,  in order  to understand  some  scientific  theories 
more than empirical data is needed. For example, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to 
know  both  the  exact  position  and  velocity  of  a  subatomic  particle  at  the  same  time  (Crotty,  1998,  p.  29). 
Post-positivism  claims  that  post-positivistic  knowledge  is  more  certain  and  objective  than  knowledge  which 
originated from other paradigms. 

Positivist  methodology  is  directed  at  explaining  relationships.  Positivists  attempt  to  identify  causes  which 
influence outcomes (Creswell, 2009, p. 7). Their aim is to formulate laws, thus yielding a basis for prediction 
and  generalization.  A  deductive  approach  is  undertaken.  Correlation  and  experimentation  are  used  to  reduce 
complex  interactions  their  constituent  parts.  Verifiable  evidence  sought  via  direct  experience  and  observation; 
this  often  involves  empirical  testing,  random  samples,  controlled  variables  (independent,  dependent  and 
moderator) and control groups. True-experiments are preferred over quasi-experiments. Cohen et al. (2007, p. 8) 
identifies  that  an  approach  which  is  characterized  by  procedure  and  methods  which  are  designed  to  discover 
general laws is nomothetic. Positivists view their methodology as value neutral, thus the knowledge generated is 
value neutral.   

Similarly, post-positivists seek to understand causal relationships; thus, experimentation and correlational studies 
are used. However more than sense-data is collected, participants perspectives are often sought. Furthermore, as 
knowledge is tentative, hypotheses are not proved but simply not rejected (Creswell, 2009, p. 7).   

The  scientific  paradigm  seeks  predictions  and  generalizations;  thus,  methods  often  generate  quantitative  data. 
Examples  include:  standardized  tests,  closed  ended  questionnaires  and  descriptions  of  phenomena  using 
standardized  observation  tools  (Pring,  2000a,  p.  34).  Analysis  involves  descriptive  and  inferential  statistics. 
Inferential statistics allow sample results to be generalized to populations.

Research  is  deemed  good  if  its  results  are  due  to  the  independent  variable  (internal  validity),  can  be 
generalized/transferred to other populations or situations (external validity), and different researchers can record 
the same data in the same way and arrive at the same conclusions (replicable and reliable). Additionally, research 
needs to be as objective as possible and robust to empirical refutation.

Header: 4. Discussion of the Scientific Paradigm   
Since methods developed to understand the natural world are not always directly transferable to the social world, 
positivism has limitations. 

Although positivism attempts to reduce the complex to the simple by simplifying and controlling variables, this 
is extremely difficult to do in educational research. Often context limits methodology; isolating variables can be 
difficult.  For  example,  project  Follow  Through  (Abt  Associates,  1977)  investigated  20  teaching  models  and 
involved 20,000 children. Many of the null hypotheses in this study could not be rejected because many of the 
treatments did not consider all contextual variables (Kennedy, 1978, p. 8-9). 

Some  variables  may  be  hidden  from  the  researcher  and  only  become  known  when  their  effects  are  evident 
(House,  1991,  p.  6).  Examples  of  fluctuating  individual  factors  include:  ordinary  life  events  (headaches)  and 
attitudes (enthusiasm). Therefore, predictions could be correct due to random reasons (Shank & Brown, 2007, p. 
28). No scientific explanation of human behavior is ever complete (Berliner, 2002, p. 20). 

Inferential statistical tests are often misused and their results are often misinterpreted. Researchers may select an 
incorrect statistical test. For example, if data is not distributed normally, then a non-parametric test is required. 
Furthermore,  the  interpretation of  P-values  is dependent on whether  you  are  hypothesis  testing or  significance 
testing, and the results of tests of statistical significance are dependent upon sample size (Blume & Peipert, 2003, 
p. 2-4). Thus, the results of inferential statistical tests cannot be taken at face-value. 

Deduction  from  empirical  generalization  is  rarely  explanatory  (Scriven,  1970,  p.  100-101).  Positivistic 
generalizations  ignore  the  intentionality  of  the  individual,  thus  actions  are  not  fully  understood.  Two  students 
who may appear to be doing the same thing could be doing different things. For example, two students write the 
answer  to  2x7.  Student  A  memorized  the  answer,  student  B  added  seven  together  twice.  Actions  need  to  be 
understood from the participants perspectives, including both process and agency. 

Positivists self-delude themselves into thinking that their research is value free. Firstly, throughout the research 
process researchers make value-laden judgments, for example: selection of variables, actions to be observed, and 
interpretation of findings (Salomon, 1991, p. 10-18). Secondly, knowledge production is political. Refusing to 
consider the political connections of produced knowledge is in itself political. 

Positivists  have  contributed  to  understanding  philosophy,  adopted  high  standards  of  rigor  and  attempted  to 
formulate  methods  which  yield  commonly  accepted  results  (Ashby,  1964,  p.  508).  Verified  observation 
statements, which are of use to policy makers, have been produced, for example evidence about the long-term 
positive  effects  of  small  class  size.  Although  certainty  is  elusive,  aspects  of  positivism  belong  in  educational 
research.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 5. Explanation of the Interpretive Paradigm 
The  ontological  position  of  interpretivism  is  relativism.  Relativism  is  the  view  that  reality  is  subjective  and 
differs from person to person (Guba & Lincoln, 1994, p. 110). Our realties are mediated by our senses. Without 
consciousness  the  world  is  meaningless.  Reality  emerges  when  consciousness  engages  with  objects  which  are 
already  pregnant  with  meaning  (Crotty,  1998,  p.  43).  Reality  is  individually  constructed;  there  are  as  many 
realities as individuals. Language does not passively label objects but actively shapes and moulds reality (Frowe, 
2001,  p.  185).  Thus,  reality  is  constructed  through  the  interaction  between  language  and  aspects  of  an 
independent world. 

The interpretive epistemology is one of subjectivism which is based on real world phenomena. The world does 
not  exist  independently  of  our  knowledge  of  it  (Grix,  2004,  p.  83).  Regarding  trees,  Crotty  (1998,  p.  43) 
elaborates, 

We need to remind ourselves here that it is human beings who have constructed it as a tree, given it the name, 
and attributed to it the associations we make with trees. 

A  tree  is  not  a  tree  without  someone  to  call  it  a  tree.  Meaning  is  not  discovered;  it  is  constructed  though  the 
interaction between consciousness and the world. Consciousness is always consciousness of something (Crotty, 
1998, p. 44). To experience a world is to participate in it, simultaneously molding and encountering it (Heron & 
Reason, 1997, p. 3). Intentionality refers to the interaction between consciousness and phenomena.

Vol. 5, No. 9; 2012 

Regarding the same phenomenon, different people may construct meaning in different ways (Crotty, 1998, p. 9) 
but truth is a consensus formed by co-constructors (Pring, 2000b, p. 251). Therefore, knowledge has the trait of 
being  culturally  derived  and  historically  situated.  The  interpretive  paradigm  does  not  question  ideologies;  it 
accepts them.     

Knowledge and meaningful reality are constructed in and out of interaction between humans and their world and 
are developed and transmitted in a social context (Crotty, 1998, p. 42). Therefore, the social world can only be 
understood  from  the  standpoint  of  individuals  who  are  participating  in  it  (Cohen  et  al.,  2007,  p.  19). 
Interpretivism aims to bring into consciousness hidden social forces and structures. 

Interpretive  methodology  is  directed  at  understanding  phenomenon  from  an  individuals  perspective, 
investigating interaction among individuals as well as the historical and cultural contexts which people inhabit 
(Creswell,  2009,  p.  8).  Examples  of  methodology  include:  case  studies  (in-depth  study  of  events  or  processes 
over  a  prolonged  period),  phenomenology  (the  study  of  direct  experience  without  allowing  the  interference  of 
existing preconceptions), hermeneutics (deriving hidden meaning from language), and ethnography (the study of 
cultural groups over a prolonged period). 

Individual constructs are elicited and understood through interaction between researchers and participants (Guba 
& Lincon, 1994, p. 111) with participants being relied on as much as possible (Creswell, 2009, p. 8). Events are 
not reduced to simplistic interpretations; new layers of understanding are uncovered as phenomena are thickly 
described.  Interpretive  theory  is  usually  grounded  (inductive),  being  generated  from  the  data,  not  preceding  it 
(Cohen et al., 2007, p. 22). Thus, research questions are broad. Cohen et al. (2007, p. 8) identify that an approach 
characterized  by  its  emphasis  on  an  individual  case,  in  which  a  relativistic  social  world  is  embedded,  is 
idiographic.  Interpretivists  acknowledge  that  value  free  knowledge  is  not  possible.  For  example,  researchers 
assert their beliefs when they choose what to research, how to research and how to interpret their data (Edge & 
Richards, 1998, p. 336). 

Interpretive  methods  yield  insight  and  understandings  of  behavior,  explain  actions  from  the  participants 
perspective,  and  do  not  dominate  the  participants.  Examples  include:  open-ended  interviews,  focus  groups, 
open-ended  questionnaires,  open-ended  observations,  think  aloud  protocol  and  role-playing.  These  methods 
usually generate qualitative data. Analyses are the researchers interpretations; consequently, researchers need to 
make their agenda and value- system explicit from the outset. 

Research  is  deemed  good  if  it:  provides  rich  evidence  and  offers  credible  and  justifiable  accounts  (internal 
validity/credibility), can be made use of by someone in another situation (external validity/transferability), and 
the research process and findings can be replicated (reliability/dependability) (Richie & Lewis, 2003, p. 263-286; 
Cohen et al, 2007, p. 133-149).

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 6. Discussion of the Interpretive Paradigm 
Although  the  interpretive  paradigm  is  sensitive  to  individual  meanings  that  can  become  buried  within  broader 
generalizations (Samdahl, 1999, p. 119), it has shortcomings. 

Interpretive  research  rejects  a  foundational  base  to  knowledge,  bringing  into  question  its  validity.  Interpretive 
research  cannot  be  judged  using  the  same  criteria  as  the  scientific  paradigm.  Legitimacy  and  trustworthiness 
need  to be  achieved  without claiming uncontested  certainty.  However,  reaching a  consensus  is problematic.  If 
reality is subjective and differs from person to person, then research participants cannot be expected to arrive at 
exactly the same interpretations as researchers (Rolfe, 2006, p. 305). Therefore, validity adding criteria such as 
triangulation, member checking and peer review are ineffective as they assume an underlying objective reality 
which can be converged upon (Angen, 2000, p. 384).     

Knowledge produced by the interpretive paradigm has limited transferability as it is usually fragmented and not 
unified into a coherent body. Generalizations which are deemed useful to policy makers are often absent because 
its  research  usually  produces  highly  contextualized  qualitative  data,  and  interpretations  of  this  data  involve 
subjective individual constructions. Consequently, policy makers are often reluctant to fund interpretive research, 
for example, the US No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 predominately promoted research based on the scientific 
paradigm (Berliner, 2002, p. 18-20).   

Participants  autonomy  and  privacy  can  be  compromised  as  the  methods  of  interpretive  research  are  more 
intimate  and  open-ended  than  scientific  research.  Intimacy  and  open-endedness  may  facilitate  the  unintended 
discovery of secrets, lies and oppressive relationships (Howe & Moses, 1999, p. 40). Researchers may have to 
decide if they have an ethical responsibility to reveal their participants or intervene in their lives, for example, 
protecting  students  from  abusive  teachers.  Additionally  the  more  information  that  researchers  give  when 

12

Vol. 5, No. 9; 2012 

constructing a thick description, the greater the risk of participant exposure. Researchers may have to tone-down 
their contextualization in order to protect participants identities. 

Participants have limited control and are vulnerable to researchers imposing their own subjective interpretations 
upon  them.  Interpretive  researchers  produce  theorized  accounts  that  represent  participants  sociological 
understandings (Danby & Farrell, 2004, p. 41). This raises issues of: who owns the data, how will the data be 
used and how much control over the findings do participants have? Even though participants are often given a 
voice, it is usually the researcher who decides on: the direction that the research takes, the final interpretation of 
the data, and which information is made public. 

The pre-existing meaning making system which we are born into distorts our understanding of phenomena and 
we are unaware of this. Interpretive research often neglects external structural forces which influence behavior 
(Cohen  et  al.,  2007,  p.  26).  Understandings  are  structured  historically  in  the  traditions,  prejudices  and 
institutional practices that come down to us (Taylor, 1993, p. 59). Therefore, participants might not be aware of 
invisible  ideology  which  guides  their  actions.  As  participants  might  not  fully  understand  the  forces  which  are 
acting on their agency, their explanations of phenomena are incomplete.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 7. Explanation of the Critical Paradigm 
The ontological position of the critical paradigm is historical realism. Historical realism is the view that reality 
has been shaped by social, political, cultural, economic, ethnic, and gender values; reality that was once deemed 
plastic has become crystallized (Guba & Lincon, 1994, p. 110). Realities are socially constructed entities that are 
under constant internal influence. 

Language does not passively label objects but actively shapes and moulds reality (Frowe, 2001, p. 185). Reality 
is  constructed  through  the  interaction  between  language  and  aspects  of  an  independent  world.  However,  the 
critical paradigm takes the view that language contains power relations so it is used to empower or weaken. 

Critical epistemology is one of subjectivism which is based on real world phenomena and linked with societal 
ideology. Knowledge is both socially constructed and influenced by power relations from within society. Cohen 
et al. (2009, p. 27) explain that, what counts as knowledge is determined by the social and positional power of 
the advocates of that knowledge. Regarding knowledge on trees, different organizations have differing beliefs. 
For  example,  the  World  Wildlife  Fund  and  logging  companies  have  differing  agendas;  therefore,  they  often 
dispute what constitutes an endangered tree. 

Social constructionism argues that we are born into a world in which meaning has already been made; we are 
born into culture. We come to inhabit a pre-existing system and to be inhabited by it, (Crotty, 1998, p. 53). 
This pre-existing system consists of consensuses about knowledge that have already been reached and are still 
being  reached.  Furthermore,  it  is  stratified  and  marked  with  inequality.  Research  interests  are  influenced  by 
culture, race, gender and location (Siegel, 2006, p. 5). Academic and scientific communities, which validate and 
legitimize knowledge claims, unwittingly contribute to systems of oppression. For example, much of the social 
and psychological  theory  which underpins the  scientific  paradigm  was  developed by  white,  able-bodied  males 
(Mertens, 2005, p. 17). As knowledge claims are always embedded in regimes of truth, consideration should be 
given to domination, exclusion, privilege and marginalization (Ceci et al., 2002, p. 714).     

The critical paradigm is anti-foundational; it attacks this reality. People are not only in the world but also with it 
(Crotty,  1998,  p.  149).  Reality  is  alterable  by  human  action.  The  critical  paradigm  seeks  to  address  issues  of 
social  justice  and  marginalism.  The  emancipatory  function  of  knowledge  is  embraced.  Different  theoretical 
perspectives of critical inquiry include: Marxism, queer theory and feminism. 

As it is culturally derived, historically situated and influenced by political ideology, knowledge is not value free. 
The critical paradigm asks the axiological question: what is intrinsically worthwhile? Thus, the critical paradigm 
is  normative;  it  considers  how  things  ought  to  be;  it  judges  reality.  The  utopian  aspirations  of  the  critical 
paradigm may never be realized but a more democratic society may materialize. 

Critical  methodology  is  directed  at  interrogating  values  and  assumptions,  exposing  hegemony  and  injustice, 
challenging  conventional  social  structures  and  engaging  in  social  action  (Crotty,  1998,  p.  157).  Inquiry  is 
inseparable from politics. Its aim is to emancipate the disempowered. Researchers embrace their ideology as they 
recognize that no research methodology is value free (Pring, 2000b, p. 250). Therefore, the starting point of a 
critical researcher is often preconceived. Finding out is the means, change is the underlying aim. This involves 
making  people  critically  aware  of  their  situation  (conscientization),  then  realizing  change  through  a  praxis, 
which  is  repeated  action  informed  by  reflection  (Freire,  1970,  p.  48).  Thus,  there  is  an  emergent,  recursive 
relationship between theory, data, research questions and interpretation (Talmy, 2010, p. 130).

Participants and researchers are both subjects in the dialectical task of unveiling reality, critically analyzing it, 
and recreating that knowledge (Freire, 1970, p. 51). Researchers do not carry out transformation for participants 
but with them (Freire, 1970, p. 49). Consequently, participants are involved in the research process, for example 
designing questions, collecting data, analyzing information and benefiting from research (Creswell, 2009, p. 9). 
Critical  methodologies  include:  critical  discourse  analysis  (examines  how  social  and  political  domination  is 
realized  in  text  and  talk),  critical  ethnography  (an  ideologically  sensitive  orientation  to  the  study  of  culture 
(Canagarajah, 1993, p. 605)), action research (a cyclical process of investigation, action and evaluation which 
results in a change in practice), and ideology critique (exposes hidden ideology by revealing participants places 
in systems which empower or disempower them.) 

Critical  methods  enable  realities  to  be  critically  examined  from  a  cultural,  historical  and  political  stance. 
Examples  include:  open-ended  interviews,  focus  groups,  open-ended  questionnaires,  open-ended  observations, 
and journals. These methods usually generate qualitative data. Similar to interpretivism, analysis often involves 
thematic interpretation of data; however, explicit values are now placed on these interpretations. 

Critical  research  should  fully  acknowledge  its  context  (culturally,  historically  and  politically)  and  promote 
dialogical  relations of  equality  between  the researchers  and  participants. Additionally,  research  must  create  an 
agenda for change or reform, enhancing the lives of the participants. It must have catalytic validity (Cohen et al., 
2007, p. 139).

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 8. Discussion of the Critical Paradigm 
The critical paradigm exposes how political ideology is inextricably interwoven with knowledge, but problems 
exist.   

Critical  research  has  an  agenda  of  change;  therefore,  it  is  often  not  supported  by  existing  regimes.  Giroux 
(Giroux,  2011)  argues  that  neoliberal  and  neoconservative  forces  are  currently  transforming  American 
universities into anti-democratic public spheres; consequently, the right of faculty to work in an autonomous and 
critical fashion is under attack. One way to control research is through funding, for example the US No Child 
Left  Behind  Act  (Berliner, 2002,  p.  18-20).  Knowledge production  is  influenced  by politics.  Often  the  critical 
paradigm is not favored by existing policy makers. 

A dialogue of equals is virtually impossible as power differentials between researchers and participants exist. For 
example,  action  research  carried  out  in  secondary  schools  might  encounter  the  following  problems.  Teachers 
control  the  research  agenda,  thus  participants  may  not  be  involved  in  the  research  design.  A  high  degree  of 
obligation will exist for students to participate; it would be difficult for a student to refuse a teacher on whom 
they are dependent for grades and access to resources (Nolen & Putten, 2007, p. 402). If participants try to please 
the researcher, the data given may not be accurate and the research findings may not be credible. Consequently, 
issues of collaboration, consent, coerciveness, and autonomy must be considered. 

Emancipation is not guaranteed. The change in the participants lives may be negligible or non-existent. Does 
the  majority  of  action  research  make  an  emancipatory  difference?  There  is  little  evidence  to  suggest  so. 
Furthermore,  once  participants  become  critically  aware  of  their  situation,  change  may  not  be  possible. 
Despondency  may  ensue  as  blissful  ignorance  is  shattered.  Alternatively,  some  participants  lives  may  be 
changed  for  the  worst.  For  example,  Rushton,  a  Canadian  psychologist,  attempted  rationalize  racist  policy  by 
linking race to intelligence and moral behavior (Howe, 2009, p. 436). 

The critical paradigm stereotypes participants in two ways. Firstly, it often labels participants as belonging to a 
particular  marginalized  group;  therefore,  homogeneous  notions  of  identity  are  superimposed.  Secondly,  the 
critical  paradigm  does  not  acknowledge  that  different  participants  enter  the  research  with  varying  levels  of 
conscientization.  It  naively  assumes  that  populations  blindly  do  the  bidding  of  powerful  regimes,  further 
enslaving themselves in the process.   

Most of the leading authors in the critical paradigm have been male, prompting feminists to criticize the critical 
paradigm as excluding the voices and concerns of marginalized groups (Burbules & Berk, 1999). Ironically, the 
critical pedagogy can be accused of maintaining societal status-quos.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 9. Conclusion 
What  knowledge  is,  and  ways  of  discovering  it,  are  subjective.  Regarding  educational  research,  the  scientific 
paradigm seeks to generalize, the interpretive paradigm seeks to understand, and the critical paradigm seeks to 
emancipate. Each paradigm has its own ways of realizing its aims. Understanding the philosophical assumptions 
that underpin each paradigm and how these assumptions manifest themselves within methodology and methods 
will enable English language teachers to better comprehend, question, and apply the research that they read.

Title: One to One Technology and its Effect on Student Academic, PDF: Research_papers_50\EJ1117604.pdf
Header: Abstract 
This research was a quantitative study using 4th grade participants from a Title 1 elementary 
school in Central Illinois.  This study set out to determine whether one to one technology (1:1 
will be used hereafter) truly impacts and effects the academic achievement of students.  This 
studys second goal was to determine whether 1:1 Technology also effects student motivation 
to  learn.    Data  was  gathered  from  students  participating  in  this  study  through  the  Pearson 
enVision Math series with Topic Tests, Discovery Education Assessment results, and attendance 
records being used.  The results show that 1:1 Technology could be a factor in student academic 
achievement  and  motivation  to  be  at  school.    These  findings  are  important  due  to  the 
technological  shift  that  schools  are  currently  facing.    With  more  technology  exposure  for 
students  and  more  professional  development  for  teachers  to  hone  their  newly  acquired 
teaching methods, 1:1 Technology may be the catalyst needed for school districts to help their 
students achieve at higher levels.

Header: Introduction 
Since No Child Left Behinds inception, high stakes testing and accountability has beleaguered school 
districts  across  the  nation.    School  officials  and  administrators  have  tried  any  and  all  sorts  of 
remedies  to  promote  student  engagement  and  success  in  the  classrooms,  this  includes 
implementing technology into curricula.  According to the United States Department of Education 
(2002), the No Child Left Behind Act also sought to eliminate the digital divide and to have student 
technologically literate by the end of the eighth grade, regardless of race, socioeconomic status, 
geographic location, and disability.

Furthermore, the State of Illinois adopted the Common Core State Standards in 2010, with them 
being fully implemented in the 2013-2014 school year.  These standards have taken the ideals from 
No Child Left Behind (NCLB) one step further with children as young as Kindergarten aged being 
computer  literate.    For  example,  instead  of  writing  extended  response  questions,  students  are 
expected  to  type  and  compose  such  responses.    Current  assessment  initiatives  require  school 
district  to  use  online  testing.  The  new  Partnership  for  Assessment  of  Readiness  for  College  and 
Careers (PARCC), which replaces the ISAT Test in the state of Illinois, will be taken online which is a 
vast  difference  between  old  state  assessments  and  new  state  assessments.    These  changes  are 
requiring school districts to provide computers and technology to their students and faculty. 

The school district participating in this study adopted an initiative for 1:1 Technology to be a part of 
classrooms in the last few years.  This past school year, the school district was able to have select 
classrooms pilot 1:1 Technology.  Teachers at the high school, junior high, and elementary levels 
were chosen by district administrators to have laptops as a resource and tool for instruction and 
learning  in  the  classroom.    The  school  district  is  working  closely  with  local  business  for  this  1:1 
initiative  to  be  district-wide  in  the  near  future.    Due  to  the  State  of  Illinois  continued  budget 
concerns, this is not happening as quickly as it was projected to be.  Teachers who are using 1:1 
Technology are at an advantage over teachers who do not have this accessibility.  1:1 Technology 
allows teachers to better and more quickly differentiate, to administer enrichment, and to also dive 
deeper into topics of study, as the Common Core State Standards puts forth these requirements for 
students.  1:1 Technology can also motivate students and allow them to be engaged on a completely 
different level than they have ever before. This study examined whether 1:1 Technology does in fact 
increase student academic achievement and increase motivation in students to learn.  

One of the main items that No Child Left Behind set out to accomplish was to diminish the digital 
divide between socioeconomic class and race of students.  The school district participating in this 
study there are two elementary schools that are inundated with higher percentages of low-income 
students.  The majority students do not have the same opportunities to be exposed or have the 
background  or  previous  knowledge  with  computing  skills  and  are  more  often  than  not, 
technologically illiterate.  Two classrooms from the participating school district were chosen to pilot 
1:1 Technology.  The hope and goal of this pilot is to see if 1:1 Technology can improve student 
academic  achievement  in  the  classroom.    This  study  then  took  that  goal  one  step  further  by 
examining the effects of 1:1 technology on student motivation. 

This  study  should  be  useful  to  legislators,  school  administrators,  and  educators  as  most  of  our 
schools are turning to technology to aid and assist in learning in the classrooms.  1:1 Technology is 
such  an  asset  to  any  school  or  classroom.    The  use  of  technology  allows  teachers  to  truly 
differentiate and tailor instruction to meet the needs of their students.  With the new Common Core 
State Standards being implemented and the new appraisal process being fully embraced by the state 
of Illinois, 1:1 Technology and being technologically literate is such an essential skill for educators, 
but more importantly, students.  This study set out to show how technology can positively affect 
student academic achievement and motivation in the classroom.

Header: Literature Review 
Technology is a recent marvel in our everyday life that has taken off.  Technology allows the most 
difficult tasks to become seamlessly easy and more efficient.  In education, technology has allowed 
the  dissemination  of  knowledge  to  be  dispersed  instantly  and  it  allows  for  quicker  and  more 
effective communication.  Also, technology has allowed students to be engaged and learn in ways 
that they never have in a classroom setting before.  According to Spears (2012) she cites Donovan, 
Hartley & Strudler (2007) and describes the first 1:1 technology program that was used in a school 
setting.  Spears (2012) states, The first provider of 1:1 computer access for teachers and students 
was Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow (ACOT).  The goal of ACOT was to promote change in the context 
of education(p. 1).  Spears continues in her study and describes Microsofts 1:1 initiative through 
the Anytime Anywhere Learning (AAL) program. Spears (p. 1) cites the work of Donovan et al. (2007), 
An increase in enthusiasm for teaching and learning with technology, an improvement in student 
writing skills, an increase of authentic and purposeful use of technologyare some of the benefits 
of 1:1 technology integration programs like the AAL program. These programs in the 1980s and 
1990s paved the way for presidents, legislators, administrators, and educators to become aware of 
how positively technology could impact the student and teacher in the classroom, alike. 

The Role of Educational Reform in Technology Development 

The role of technology in the world of education has been ever changing.  Most recently, technology 
has been a new phenomenon to help motivate, differentiate, and allow students to achieve and 
excel in ways that they have never been able to before.  According to Johnson (2003), the computer 
and  technology,  if  used  correctly,  has  the  ability  to  invoke  dream  in  the  minds  of  visionary 
educators who saw endless potential for altering traditional notions of teaching and learning (p. 
2).  Two  past  presidents  saw  the  need  for  fundamental  change  in  education  to  keep  American 
students  in  competition  with  technology  with  other  students  from  around  the  world.    In  1994, 
President Bill Clinton signed The Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Goals 2000: Educate America 
Act, 1994).  There were many parts of this bill that involved technology and education.  Part C of The 
Goals  2000:  Educate  America  Act,  Leadership  in  Technology,  (a)  calls  upon  the  Department  of 
Education to create a national strategy to involve technology into all educational programs and the 
state and local school systems, (b) foster understanding of how technology can be used to improve 
teaching and learning, (c) show how technology can be used to create an equal opportunity for all 
students to be successful while meeting state education requirements, and (g) create high-quality 
professional education opportunities for educators with the ability to integrate technology into their 
instruction (Goals 2000: Educate America Act, 1994). 

After President Bill Clinton signed this bill into action, President George W. Bush pushed one step 
further with education and technology while he passed the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act in 2001.  
This  bill  sought  to  close  the  achievement  gap  in  education,  while  also  creating  accountability 
amongst schools and states, alike, and choice and flexibility so no child is left behind in education.  
(No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 2002).  The goal of Part D of the No Child Left Behind Act was to 
improve student academic achievement through the use of technology.   The main points of Part D, 
Enhancing  Education  through  Technology  Act  of  2001  include,  (a)  assistance  to  states  for  the 

370 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, 2016, 7(4), 368-381 

implementation of technology into schools, elementary and secondary, to promote and encourage 
student academic achievement, (b) establish and develop technology initiatives in regards to access 
to technology, (c) assistance for acquisition of technology, which increases the amount of students 
who  have  accessibility  to  technology,  (e)  professional  development  initiatives  for  teachers  and 
administrators,  (h)  supports  for  efforts  to  involve  families  in  education  and  to  help  in 
communication (No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 2002).  The No Child Left Behind Act also sought 
to  decrease the  digital  divide  between  students and  to  also  use  best  practices  while  integrating 
technology with teacher training to establish research-based instructional methods. 

Again in 2009, President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which 
provided $4.35 billion for the Race to the Top Fund for education innovation and reform (Race to 
the Top Program Executive Summary, 2009).  Spears (2012) cites Duncan (2009), the United States 
Secretary  of  Education,  refers  to  Race  to  the  Top  as  education  reforms  moon  shot  in  a 
commentary describing the largest unrestricted fund for education in the history of the country.  
Spears (2012, p. 3) states in her work that the emphasis of Priority 2 of Race to the Top (Race to the 
Top Executive Summary, 2009, p. 1) is the rigorous preparation of students in science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  In 2010 the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and 
Technology issued a report to the president.  This report indicated that there is the need for urgency 
of preparing American students with a strong foundation in science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics in order for students to transfer this knowledge in their personal and professional lives, 
which  will  then  also  impact  the  American  society.  Spears  (2012,  p.  4)  states  that  the  Council 
acknowledges that ICT can be a driving force for education innovation through the improvement of 
instructional material quality, the development of high-quality assessments that indicate student 
learning, and the increased use of data to provide rich feedback to students, teachers, and schools 
(Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2010, p. 73).

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: Educational Technology Challenges 
Although these past presidents were able to have legislation passed, there are still many difficulties 
with technology being introduced and immersed in schools (Brinkerhoff, 2006).  Legislation being 
passed is not enough.  There are so many students without accessibility, and the digital divide still 
exists in schools to this day.  The financial constraints that the school districts and states are under 
make  immersing  technology  even  more  difficult.    The  cost,  infrastructure,  and  technology 
development in schools across the country is not the same.  Most technology used in schools are 
computer labs that classes can schedule times for students use, or some schools have three to four 
desktop  computers  for  classroom  and  teacher  use  in  the  classrooms.    There  are  some  school 
districts,  however,  that  are  able  to  provide  1:1  Technology  experiences  for  students,  but  not  all 
students have this accessibility.  In some school districts, it will take many years for 1:1 Technology 
to be present in all classrooms. 

The Benefits and Requirements of a 1:1 Educational Technology Initiative 

As 1:1 Technology is a rather new phenomenon in the educational world, it needs to be introduced 
carefully and with consideration.  Technology, being laptops or devices, should be seen as tools and 

371 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, 2016, 7(4), 368-381 

not replacements of best practices for teaching in the classroom.  Another important component of 
1:1 Technology is student motivation.  The teacher in the classroom must understand how and why 
students are motivated to learn.  In her study, Spears (2012) cites the work of Keller.  Spears (2012, 
p. 8) cites the work of Keller (1987) and explains, Attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction 
(ARCS) are the four characteristics one needs to establish in order for people to be motivated to 
learn.  When looking to implement 1:1 Technology into a classroom, educators must look closely 
at their student population to understand who they are working with, how their students will learn 
best, and how to build their confidence with technology so they will, in return, be satisfied with their 
learning experience, and thus become motivated to learn.  Educators cannot simply use technology 
as a replacement.  Sansone et al.  (2011) addresses motivation and note that students who already 
have a greater interest in computers may display greater knowledge and interest because the tasks 
they  may  do  on  a  computer  are  already  relevant  to  their  interests  and  they  are  able  to  make 
connections on their own.  This finding from Sansone et al. (2011) shows the importance of using 
the four characteristics  from Keller (1987).  Attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction all 
come into play with educators and students for technology to be introduced and used effectively in 
the classroom.  In another study of 1:1 technology implementation in Texas, Shapley et al. (2011, p. 
299) noted, technology immersion had a positive effect on students technology proficiency and 
frequency of their technology-based class activities and small-group interactions.  With more and 
more emphasis being placed on student learning and achievement, schools are looking at making 
changes and immersing students and teachers with technology.  With that, though, comes the ability 
and responsibility to train and uphold high standards of learning with both teachers and students. 

Mark  Edwards,  a  superintendent  in  Mooresville,  North  Carolina,  has  successfully  launched  1:1 
laptop initiatives in two school districts as acting superintendent.  In this article, Edwards (2012) 
explains the excitement and energy factor that students have when learning due to 1:1 Technology 
being implemented.  Edwards continues and explains in Mooresville the school district has created 
a very hands-on approach and exploratory way of learning with their technology.  Edwards describes 
how teachers feel that even though the technology is in place and they are seeing academic gains 
in  the  classroom,  most  of  these  teachers  would  say  that  teaching  is  not  easier.    If  anything, 
implementing 1:1  technology  has made  teaching more  difficult  and  complex.   Teaching  with  1:1 
technology requires significant changes for individuals and teams with an exception for everyone 
to be committed to growth and improvement. Success in the classroom depends more than ever on 
the talent, initiative, and skills of the teacher (Edwards, 2012, p. 6).  Teaching is much more of a 
hands-on approach with 1:1 technology.  Edwards calls this kind of teacher a roaming conductor.  
This kind of teacher will move about the classroom engaging the students by posing questions and 
engaging students as needed. 

One of the key elements in the instructional designs for this 1:1 laptop initiative in North Carolina is 
professional  development.    Edwards  (2012,  p.  8)  states,  professional  development  is  vital  to 
successful  teaching.    He  continues  to  explain  that  student  success  is  connected  to  professional 
growth in teachers.  1:1 technology initiatives are not an isolated event with just one teacher; these 
kinds of technology initiatives take a building and culture of wanting to grow  and change for the 
betterment  of  the  students  that  are  taught.    As  expectations  are  raised,  teachers  have  been 
thoughtful and have used praxis to reflect upon the decisions they are making in the classroom when 
it comes to learning and achievement.  According to Cavanaugh, Dawson and Ritzhaupt (2011) they 
state when a learning environment is comprised and changed with 1:1 technology that also, in turn, 

372 

 
 
 
 
CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, 2016, 7(4), 368-381 

will change the teaching practices that are used in those classrooms.  Cavanaugh et al.  (2011, p. 
360)  cite  the  work  of  Barrios  (2004)  and  note  the  primary  motivation  for  laptop  classroom 
technology and accompanying teacher professional development is the belief that the new learning 
environment  will  support  engaged  students  an  increases  in  academic  achievement.    Without 
professional  development  for  teachers,  these  academic  gains  and  increases  would  be  nearly 
impossible.  The Florida Department of Education funded program, Leveraging Laptops: Effective 
Models  for  Enhancing  Student  Academic  Achievement,  professional  development  was  a  main 
component of this program for educators.  Each teacher involved with this technology initiative was 
required  to  a  four-day  institute  that  focused  on  student-centered,  tool-based  technology 
integration (Cavanaugh et al., 2011, p. 360).  In some districts that participated in this study, there 
were continual professional development opportunities online, and even some with small learning 
communities, coaching and modeling, technology trainers, and customary consulting.  In order for 
technology  immersion  programs  to  be  successful  and  obtain  the  outcomes  that  are  desired, 
increased  learning opportunities  and  higher  academic  achievement,  these  steps  that  the  Florida 
Department of Education put in place to assist teachers with learning opportunities and growth is 
essential. 

In order for any 1:1 technology initiative to become successful, funding must first be present.  If 
there  is  no  money  to  fund  these  initiatives  and  then  fund  the  increased  costs  of  manpower, 
infrastructure,  and  professional  development,  these  initiatives  will  be  ineffective  and  it  will  be 
difficult to obtain the desired results.  As Race to the Top and the Common Core State Standards 
take  effect,  school  districts  across  the  state  of  Illinois  and  other  states  are  looking  for  ways  to 
increase student academic achievement and also prepare students for the demands of college and 
careers  they  may  hold  in  the  future.    Technology  is  a  tool  that  students  and  adults  may  use 
frequently outside of the classroom, but bringing technology into the classroom can allow students 
and teachers to learn in ways they never have before, thus changing the role of the teacher, the 
learner, and the environment in which learning takes place.

Technology was responsible for student academic achievement and motivation.  The participants in 
this study are Fourth Grade students who attend school in Central Illinois.  1:1 Technology is a recent 
phenomenon  in  school  districts  across  the  country.    As  our  world  becomes  more  enriched  with 
technology, school officials and administrators are looking for the positive impacts that technology 
can offer teachers and students, alike, in the classroom through meaningful and engaging teaching 
methods and instruction.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: Participants 
The  participants  in  this  quantitative  study  were  Fourth  Grade  students  from  two  different 
classrooms,  but  in  the  same  Title  1  School,  located  in  Central  Illinois.  According  to  the  Illinois 
Interactive  Report  Card  (2013),  the  school  has  a  low-income  rate  of  84.3%,  with  40.5%  of  the 
students  being  African-American,  15.2%  Multiracial,  32.3%  Caucasian,  10.2%  Hispanic,  1.0% 
American-Indian, and 0.7% Asian.   

This  study  examined  how  1:1  Technology  affects  participants  academic  achievement  and 
motivation in the classroom.  The study focused particularly on the Discovery Education Assessment, 
which is given four times a year, and also end of Topic Tests in Math to see if there are any significant 
differences in student scoring.   

To gauge the motivational aspect of this research, monthly attendance records for each class were 
used.  The school participating in this study splits the school day in half into Periods 1 and 2. The 
number of absences was determined by adding the number of absences from Periods 1 and 2 for 
each classroom.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: Instrumentation 
In this study, Topic Tests in Math, Discovery Education Assessment (Math) results, and attendance 
were used to determine whether 1:1 Technology positively impacts student academic achievement 
and motivation in students.  The Topic Tests were derived from the Pearson enVision Math series 
that has been adopted by the Bloomington Public School District 87.  This specific Math series is 
Common Core State Standard aligned and teaches the language and lessons to meet these learning 
standards.  The Topic Tests are used as summative assessments to gauge the mastery of Math skills.  

The Discovery Education Assessment is an assessment that is administered via computer four times 
per  school  year.    According  to  the  Discovery Education  Assessment  Research,  this  assessment  is 
used as a predictive benchmark assessment that provides data using states curriculum standards 
and subskills for each item on the test.  The Discovery Education Assessment can be used to improve 
instruction, help strengthen students academic skills, and increase proficiency, as measured under 
No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top.  These four assessments are administered throughout the 
school year with 9-12 weeks between each assessment.  The predictive benchmark assessments are 
intended to predict performance on the next high-stakes test the student will take during the school 
year.

Discovery Education Assessment uses a vertical scale score with scores  ranging from 1000-2000.  
Discovery Education uses the Rasch Model of Item Response Theory (IRT), a single parameter model, 
to calculate the vertical scale.  Attendance records were also analyzed to determine if there are any 
patterns of students being at school due to their motivation to learn with 1:1 Technology.

Header: Results 
The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  determine  whether  1:1  Technology  effects  student  academic 
achievement and motivation.  1:1 Technology refers to the technological movement of every child 
in the classroom, school, school district, etc., having a laptop in the classroom to manipulate and 
learn with as a tool.  In the 1:1 Implementation classroom, 25 students participated in the study, 
whereas in the traditional classroom, only 22 students participated.  The discrepancies between the 
numbers  of  students  participating  could  skew  or  misrepresent  the  data  that  is  gathered  and 
analyzed for this study.  The data gathered was then put into tables and figures to determine if 1:1 
Implementation does truly effect student academic achievement and motivation.  The motivational 
aspect  for  this  study  was  measured  using  the  student  attendance  records.  The  school  that 
participated in this study splits the whole school day into Periods 1 and 2.

Davis & Elkins College (D&E) is a private, 

four-year, comprehensive liberal arts college that 
stresses small class sizes and strong faculty-student 
interaction.  The Department of Biology and 
Environmental Science offers a curriculum designed 
to promote science as a process of inquiry and instill 
within students an appreciation of the underlying 
unity and diversity of life.  To meet the needs of 
students with diverse career interests, three degree 
options are offered: the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in 
Biology, the Bachelor of Science in Environmental 
Science, and the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Biology 
and Environmental Science.   

In 2004, we published a program-level 

assessment of the B.S. in Biology degree (Stover and 
Mabry, 2004).  We focused on student competence in 
the five areas outlined by our 2001 departmental 
assessment plan: 1) content knowledge, 2) writing 
skills, 3) speaking skills, 4) ability to interpret 
primary literature, and 5) research skills (laboratory 
and/or field). 

As we indicated in the previous study, the 
interpretation of biological data requires a specific 
knowledge base.  To comprehend and integrate 
information from different areas of biological 
inquiry, students should be familiar with fundamental 
concepts associated with each area, including the 
molecular basis of heredity, cell structure and 
function, biological evolution, and the 
interdependence of organisms.  Furthermore, 
communication skills are essential for biologists as 
they generate data, share their findings, and build on 
the work of others.  Successful communication 

depends on both the ability to effectively convey 
information (written and oral) and the ability to 
interpret and evaluate information presented by peers 
(Feldman et al., 2001).  Analyzing primary literature 
allows students to enhance their critical thinking 
skills as they participate in the dissemination of 
scientific information (Houde, 2000; Smith, 2001).

In addition to math, physics, and chemistry 
requirements, biology majors at D&E must take five

BIOL 302  Cell & Molecular Biology 

With the exception of BIOL 305, all core 

courses require written laboratory reports (BIOL 305 
requires a term paper).  Biology majors are 
introduced to laboratory reports in BIOL 101, 
allowed to hone their skills in BIOL 102, and 
expected to demonstrate competence in scientific 
writing by scoring between 80 and 100% on all 
reports required for BIOL 205 and 302.  Figure 1 
provides a sample laboratory report format.     

Abstract (8 points) 
Briefly summarize the report.  Include basic aspects of each section in the summary.  Start with an introductory sentence or two to describe the 
underlying question.  In a few sentences, describe the experiments you performed to address the question.  What were your results and how 
do they compare with information you found in the literature? 

Introduction (20 points) 
The introduction should consist of general background information.  Basic concepts associated with the topic should be covered, but you should 
not discuss the actual experiments you performed.  Reference all material you obtain from outside sources in the body of the text (author, 
date). 

Methods (8 points) 
Write out, in complete sentences, the procedures that you followed to perform each experiment. 

Results (12 points) 
Write out the result of each individual experiment.  Include graphs and/or tables, as well as text, to present your data.  Do not interpret data in 
this section; simply present your findings. 

Discussion (40 points) 
This is the most important section.  In the discussion, you should attempt to interpret the data you have collected.  Analyze the result of each 
experiment individually.  How do these results compare to information found in the literature?  Does the literature support or contradict your 
results?  Offer potential reasons for conflicting results.  Suggest alternative or follow-up procedures to further analyze the question.  Reference 
any information you find to help explain your results. 

Miscellaneous (12 points) 
Lab reports should be written in paragraph form (double-spaced).  Check spelling and grammar.  Each section should have its own heading.  You 
must reference all information you obtain from outside sources and include an alphabetical literature cited section at the end of the report.  
Items in the literature cited section should contain the following information:  Author(s).  Year of Publication.  Title of Article.  Title of Journal 
Volume: Page Numbers. 

Figure 1. Laboratory Report Format for BIOL 302. 

To fulfill departmental requirements, 

biology majors must complete Current Topics in 
Biology (BIOL 335), a one-credit course that 
involves the analysis and discussion of current 
research articles.  As described in the 2004 study, 
students in BIOL 335 carefully analyze recent journal 
articles, which are given to them one week prior to an 
in-class discussion.  Students and a faculty facilitator 

then discuss the paper and compare notes.  The goal 
is for students to become comfortable with graphical 
representations of data and the interpretation of 
experimental results.  The instructor usually selects 
articles with a common theme.  Figure 2 contains 
instructions for analyzing journal articles, while 
Figure 3 provides citations of representative articles.

assessment plan was the evaluation of research skills.  
Participating in laboratory exercises may reinforce 
biological concepts, and students may pick up some 
valuable skills in the process.  Ultimately, however, 
students must be actively involved in scientific 
research to fully understand it.  In the 2004 paper, we 
outlined a plan to implement and expand 
experimental systems developed as part of Research 
Link 2000, a project initiated by the National Science 
Foundations Council for Undergraduate Research to 
provide convenient model systems for undergraduate

experimental systems would facilitate the 
introduction of research-based laboratory activities 
into the undergraduate curriculum.

Biomedical Research Excellence (WV-INBRE).  The 
WV-INBRE is a consortium of institutions of higher 
education in West Virginia, organized under the 
direction of the Marshall University School of 
Medicine (MUSOM) and the West Virginia 
University Health Sciences Center (WVUHSC).  The 
consortium is funded through the National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) to develop biomedical research 
programs at the states predominantly undergraduate 
institutions (PUIs) and to stimulate student interest in 
graduate training in the biomedical sciences.  WV-
INBRE provides equipment grants and pilot research 
grants to investigators at PUIs to fund undergraduate 
research.  Furthermore, students at PUIs have the 
opportunity to work in biomedical research 
laboratories during the summer, under the direction 
of mentors at MUSOM and WVUHSC.   

In the current study, we reassess the content 

knowledge, communication skills, and research 
experiences of our B.S. in Biology graduates, five 
years after the original assessment.  

Methods 

We tracked the progress of the 10 students 

in the B.S. Biology program (from 2005 to 2009) 
who completed the five core content courses, the C-
BASE, BIOL 335, and BIOL 397.  Student 
competence was evaluated according to criteria 
outlined in the 2001 departmental assessment plan.  
Five of the students participated in WV-INBRE-
sponsored undergraduate research on the D&E

or WVUHSC (Figure 6).  Two of the five 
participated in research both at D&E and as summer 
interns at WVUHSC.  One of the five interned at 
WVUHSC for two consecutive summers.  Research 
projects spanned various biomedical disciplines, 
including cell biology, immunology, neuroscience, 
physiology, and toxicology.  Research on the D&E 
campus required students to spend approximately 

nine hours per week in the laboratory, for a total of 
24 weeks, during the school year.  Summer interns 
worked, on average, about eight hours per day, five 
days per week, for a total of nine weeks.  Students 
participating in research were given up to four credit 
hours of BIOL 390 (Undergraduate Research in 
Biology) and were required to orally present the 
results of their work in a public forum.  

Figure 6. A D&E student at work in a toxicology lab at MUSOM. 

Results 

All 10 students scored medium or high 

on the Fundamental Concepts of Life Science 
component of the C-BASE (since 2005, just under 
60% of non-science majors at D&E have scored 
medium or high on this component of the exam), 
scored 80% or higher on all laboratory reports in 
BIOL 205 and 302, successfully completed Current 
Topics and Senior Seminar, and demonstrated 
competence in all laboratory skills associated with 
core courses.  All 10 students graduated with the B.S. 
degree in Biology.  All five research participants put 
in the required workload and presented their data, 
first in poster format at a WV-INBRE research 
symposium (Figure 7), then as an oral presentation, 

either as part of D&Es annual Biology and 
Environmental Science Forum, or as part of the Chi 
Beta Phi (a national science honorary) National 
Conference.  Of the five research participants, two 
went to medical school, and three entered graduate 
programs (in biotechnology, exercise physiology, and 
neuroscience).  Of the five students who did not 
participate in undergraduate research, one is 
completing a graduate degree in sports medicine, one 
has graduated from optometry school, one is 
currently in pharmacy school, one has a hospital 
administrative position (she was a double major in 
biology and business), and one is working as a 
veterinary technician and is planning to apply to 
veterinary school.

Discussion 

In many ways, a small liberal arts college 
can provide the ideal setting for learning science.  
Classes are generally small, and active learning is 
often encouraged.  Previous studies have 
demonstrated that a small group dynamic (even in a 
large enrollment class) can improve student learning 
and performance in the science classroom (Tessier, 
2007).  Furthermore, class discussions can be utilized 
to stimulate critical thinking (Stover and Mabry, 
2005), and case studies can be employed to address 
students prior knowledge (Gallucci, 2006) and train 
them to develop experimental procedures (Dinan, 
2005).  Finally, it is sometimes possible to integrate 
the lecture and laboratory sections of a science 
course.  Recent research has demonstrated that this 
seamless classroom experience can have a positive 
influence on both conceptual understanding and 
academic achievement (Burrowes and Nazario,

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: 2008).  The Department of Biology and 
Environmental Science at D&E has been able to 
incorporate all these pedagogical strategies into the 
curriculum.   

Hands-on, independent research, as 
indicated by previous studies, allows students to hone 
the skills necessary to do science (in both laboratory 
and field), nurture a deeper appreciation of science, 
and sample scientific research as a career choice 
(Lopatto, 2004; Seymour et al., 2004; Clerkin, 2007).  
However, while it is always encouraged, actual 
scientific research may not be emphasized (or even 
possible) at a small liberal arts college.  WV-INBRE 
has made it possible for some biology students at 
D&E to experience the best of both worlds: the 

informal, student-centered environment of the small 
liberal arts college and the high tech, hands-on 
environment of the biomedical research laboratory.  
While individual research experiences were certainly 
unique, each student who completed the 9-week 
internship and presented data was given a pass 
grade for BIOL 390.  Presentations varied in terms of 
quality.  Some students presented their piece of the 
research puzzle, while others attempted to explain the 
big picture.  However, they all had an experience 
that could not have been provided without the WV-
INBRE grant.  

It should be noted that the biology 
curriculum at D&E is quite rigorous (as it is at other 
institutions).  Students who survive the gauntlet of 
biology, chemistry, and physics courses are, in 
general, very good students.  Our placement of 
students in graduate and professional programs is 
consistently between 85 and 90%.  However, 
personal communications from representatives at 
various graduate and professional programs suggest 
that research experiences can dramatically improve 
an applicants chances of being accepted.  Students 
interested in attending graduate programs in the 
sciences, in particular, can strengthen their 
applications significantly by participating in 
undergraduate research.  Previous studies have 
suggested that students participating in undergraduate 
research have a higher likelihood of pursuing 
advanced study and, ultimately, a career in research 
(Nagda et al. 1998; Bauer and Bennett 2003). 

We are still not completely satisfied with the 

B.S. in Biology program.  Because the WV-INBRE 
internships are competitive, we cannot guarantee a

18 Volume 36 (1) May 2010 

Stover & Mabry 

 
 
 
 research experience for every biology 

student.  Furthermore, not every biology student is 
interested in doing biomedical research.  We recently 
obtained funding to support a few undergraduate 
research projects in the ecological and environmental 
sciences, and we will continue to provide our 
students with as many opportunities for experiential 
learning as possible.  Although we still have a long 
way to go, our ultimate goal is to provide an 

independent research experience for every student in 
the program to complement the active learning 
environment we provide in the classroom.

Header: Introduction
Scientific research has played a major
role in the betterment of humanity. Due to
ongoing research in the area of biological
sciences a huge amount of valuable data
has been generated in recent years and it is
estimated that
these data are almost
doubling each year [1]. This immense
amount of data requires ample storage,
easy updating, and accessibility to all the
researchers around the world [2].

Computers and the

Internet have
become an integral part of research in
different areas of science and technology;

without these tools rapid advancement is
no longer possible [3]. Use of these tools
for addressing problems
in molecular
biology has given rise to new disciplines
termed computational biology or bioin-
formatics [4]. These disciplines are rela-
tively new fields in Pakistan where they
were recently introduced, first by various
workshops and then by the introduction
of different undergraduate degree pro-
grams.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: The Rise of Bioinformatics in
Pakistan

Pakistan is rich in genetic resources,
such as
its diverse human population,
crops, and other species. These resources
have proved useful in understanding and
solving a range of biological problems
particularly relevant to this part of the
world. In agriculture, for example, numer-
field
ous new varieties of a number of
crops have been developed, most notably
of cereals [1]. However,
in some other
important and interesting fields of re-
search, such as drug development, protein
expression assays, population genetics, and
clinical
further
trials, much room for
development remains. Such progress may
be achieved through more effective utili-
zation of
the skilled human resources
available in Pakistan, and result in signif-
icant advancement in scientific research
[1].

Bioinformatics was introduced in Paki-
stan in 2003, when two undergraduate
degree programs in this field were intro-
duced in Islamabad at the COMSATS
Information Technology
Institute

of

such as

(CIIT) and Muhammad Ali Jinnah Uni-
versity. These two institutions are consid-
ered pioneers in the field of bioinformatics
similar
education in Pakistan. Later,
bachelor degree programs in this disci-
pline were introduced in other universi-
ties,
the International Islamic
University (Islamabad), Government Col-
lege University (Faisalabad), and the
University of Veterinary and Animal
Sciences (Lahore). The number of such
programs has progressively grown to
about 11 different institutions offering an
undergraduate degree program in the
field (Figure 1), while a few universities
have also launched postgraduate degrees
(MS and PhD)
in bioinformatics and
related fields (Table 1).

Header: Biology Curriculum
Because of the importance of bioinfor-
matics to the biological sciences, in 2006 the
Higher Education Commission of Pakistan
(HEC) defined a curriculum for a BS
bioinformatics degree program and advised
all public and private universities to include
bioinformatics as a subject in the curriculum
of all undergraduate biology degree pro-
grams(http://www.hec.gov.pk/InsideHEC/
Divisions/AECA/CurriculumRevision/Doc
uments/Bioinformatics-2006.pdf).

This step could play a major role in
popularizing the area of research amongst
potential future researchers of Pakistan in
the field of biology. To date only a small
number of institutions have adopted this
advice; the rest of them, hopefully, will
follow in the near future.

Header: Careers for Bioinformatics
Graduates

Graduates of most professional

fields
have the option of joining the correspond-
ing industry in Pakistan. However, this
option is not available to local bioinfor-
matics graduates, because the bioinfor-
matics industry simply does not yet exist. It
has been estimated through personal
observations and interviews that roughly
250 bioinformatics graduates are being
produced in the country every year with a
significant gender bias
tilting towards
females. No published data are available

the postgraduate level

but it has also been observed that many
female graduates leave study and take up
family responsibilities as they get married.
The remaining graduates overall continue
to study at
in
bioinformatics,
locally or internationally.
Sweden is the most popular destination
due to the high quality of education
available and the absence of any tuition
fees for international students. Some of the
graduates leave the field of bioinformatics
and join biosciences based on wet labora-
tory research. The remaining minority
transfers either to computer sciences or
entirely different areas such as business

administration. Most of
the local or
returning postgraduates find placements
within the bioinformatics and biosciences
faculties in the local
institutions in the
country.

Human Resource Development
in Pakistan

Training a new skilled workforce and
developing the existing one play a signif-
icant role in developing a novel discipline
in any country. For this purpose local
graduates need to be trained at
the
(MS / PhD) in other
postgraduate level

countries where this field is more estab-
lished and advanced.

Realizing this fact, the Pakistan EMBnet
National Node at the CIIT lobbied the
HEC to allocate funds for this purpose.
Following successful
lobbying the HEC,
realizing the importance of this field of
study, approved 50 PhD scholarships in
bioinformatics, and the first 16 scholars
were sent to Sweden. This was done with
the intention that once these and subse-
quent scholars returned from their studies
they would be inducted in groups of five in
ten different current and future units
working in the area of bioinformatics. It
was hoped that
in a
significant boost in research and teaching in
Bioinformatics in Pakistan. Since its incep-
tion, the HEC has funded human resource
development in the higher education area
of the country through a sustained funding
initiative providing scholarships for study
and research in developed countries as well
as locally. Information about such pro-
grams is available on their website (http://

In addition to various teaching activities
since 2003, a few workshops and confer-
ences have also been supported financially
by the HEC on bioinformatics in highly
ranked institutions such as the Dr. Panj-
wani Center for Molecular Medicine and
Drug Research (Karachi), CEMB, Uni-
the Punjab (Lahore), CIIT/
versity of
COMSTECH Secretariat
(Islamabad),
and Kohat University of Science and
Technology (Kohat). Some self-supported
mini-workshops were also arranged by a
number of universities (Table 2).

Header: Joining International Forums in
Bioinformatics

The International Society for Compu-
tational Biology (ISCB), a global organi-
zation dedicated to the advancement of
scientific understanding of living systems
through computation, provides an excel-
lent forum for the interaction of research-
ers in the area of bioinformatics, which is
highly beneficial for the members. How-
ever, only a handful of researchers from
Pakistan have joined this society. Although
there are special rates for the subscription
fee, it is still expensive by local standards.
Moreover funding for participation in the
events organized by the ISCB is very
limited.

A significant step was taken in 2006
when CIIT was elected as EMBnet
Pakistan National Node. This step pro-

local
vided international exposure for
bioinformaticians and opportunities
to
collaborate with the international players
in the field. It was through this collabo-
ration that
the University of Uppsala
(Sweden) designed a special postgraduate
program for Pakistani graduates who
were sponsored by HEC. The students
were selected by an international panel
comprising Erik Bongcam-Rudloff, Sha-
hid Nadeem Chohan, Raheel Qamar,
and a representative from HEC. The
EMBnet also helped set up a local server,
called e-Biokit, which offers an online
suite of bioinformatics programs to local
users and is currently available only
within CIIT [5].

Promoting Liaisons with the
Local Industry

In order to promote bioinformatics in
Pakistan, liaisons between researchers and
the local
industry must be promoted as
well. The International Islamic University
took a step in this direction by organizing a
national seminar in 2010, Bioinformatics
and Pakistani Industries seminar(http://
www.thefreelibrary.com/International+Isl
amic+University+seminar+on+Bioinforma
tics,+Pakistan-a0241676116).

The seminar attracted an audience
from across Pakistan and was attended
by representatives from universities, the
HEC, and industry as represented by the
President of the Chamber of Commerce.
More seminars like this would stimulate
interaction between academia and indus-
try, which will be very useful
for the
overall development of
computational
require
biology in Pakistan. This will
concerted efforts by both the industry
and the academic and research commu-
nities of the country.

In the absence of local bioinformatics
industry in the country,
the academic
and research institutions can also come
forward with initiatives to launch new
companies based on the spin-off com-
is
panys model. Such an initiative
currently underway by the CIIT. A
concept paper has been developed and
submitted to the CIIT to set up a new
company that will employ about 30 fresh
bioinformatics graduates. These gradu-
ates will have on-the-job experience
while carrying out commercially viable
projects under the supervision of experi-
enced faculty who will be on the board
of directors of
company. The
this
concept paper was prepared by three
faculty members of
the CIIT (Raheel
Qamar, Shahid Chohan, and Nazim
Rahman).

Header: Bioinformatics Scientific
Societies

A professional national

society can
provide a very useful platform for produc-
tive professional
interaction among local
scientists and researchers. Keeping this in
mind, the Bio-informatics Society of Paki-
stan was announced during a conference at
the School of Biological Sciences, Punjab
University in 2008. This news was covered
by the local media (http://www.daily.pk/
bio-informatics-society-established-at-pun-
jab-university-pakistan-4756/). The mis-
sion of this society was to promote the
exchange of ideas and the development of
infrastructure and resources in the fields of
bioinformatics and computational biology,
and to facilitate interaction and collabo-
ration among scientists and educators
around the country. Unfortunately, since
the conference no further progress in this
area has been achieved, and nothing
substantial has been done by the society
since its formation.

However, due to the personal interest
and enthusiasm of bioinformatics students
from different universities of Pakistan, a
regional
student group (RSG-Pakistan)
was established in 2010. This group,
which is affiliated with the ISCB, was
intended as a platform for students to
communicate with each other, discuss
their projects, and share their knowledge.
The primary goal of RSG-Pakistan is to
help students gain exposure in the field of
computational biology; the group has also
set up a bulletin board where students
discuss their problems and research activ-
ities
(http://groups.google.com/group/
ISCB-RSG-Pakistan).

The RSG-Pakistan is providing a virtual
forum for the mutual
interaction and
benefit of the local bioinformatics students,
researchers, academicians, and industry
representatives. Currently there are coor-

representing seven universities
and coordinators from local industry are
now being sought. As there is no bioinfor-

the best
candidate for
this purpose. Moreover,
national and local bioinformatics related
events are also advertised on their website
(http://www.iscbsc.org/rsg/rsg-pakistan).
The RSG-Pakistan is also trying to
organize virtual internships, virtual con-
ferences,
seminars, and collaborations
with other domestic societies and groups
in order
to organize and expand its
national base and further activities in
the field. Although this forum does not
for
provide direct support
it has the

Recently several

in Pakistan follow;

tertiary educational
institutions in Pakistan have started offer-
ing postgraduate programs in bioinfor-
matics and, with them, research groups
are also being established in these institu-
tions. Some of these groups are conducting
basic research, while a few of them are
making impressive progress in novel areas.
Three examples of the increasing number
of programs
their
research papers can be found in a number
of peer-reviewed journals or in online
indexes such as PubMed.
N The Bioinformatics Research Group
(BRG) was established at the CIIT,
Islamabad (http://cub.comsats.edu.

Title: A Research Paper on Modern Technology, PDF: Research_papers_50\JETIREO06025.pdf
Header: INTRODUCTION 
The 21st century period is often called a technical phase. In today's life, technology plays a major part. It is 
considered  to  be  the  basis  of  economic  growth.  In  the  present  scenario,  an  economy  that  is  poor  in 
technology can never grow. This is because technology simplifies and gives our work a lot less time. In 
every possible field, the impact of technology can be felt in education. Modern technology in education [1]. 
According to the new research into the precise use of technology by contemporary students today and how 
their learning has a negative impact when using technology, the use of modern equipment and software, 
learning and contact between students has become increasingly evident [2]. 

They find it much more interactive and with technology help, as well as a lot of interesting fields. What this 
means is, that our minds now tend to work faster when assisted with the use of modern technology, be it 
any  part  of  life,  here  we  talk  about  education.  The  reliance  and  dependence  of  such  an  innovation,  that 
simply  makes  life  an  easy,  smooth  journey  is  completely  unavoidable  these  days  even  in  schools, 
universities and colleges. Students today can make use of technology in the following ways [3]. 

INTERNET CONNECTION AND ROUND THE CLOCK CONNECTIVITY 

What this implies is that we think about information in every part of our lives; as our minds get helped by 
advanced  technology,  we  tend  to  work  easier.  It  is  absolutely  unavoidable  that  such  an  invention  is 
dependency and dependence that makes life simple and smooth today even in classrooms, universities and 
colleges [4]. The following technology is used by today's students.

Header: Using projectors and visuals 
Visual  images  always  have  a  strong  appeal  compared  to  words.  Using  projectors  and  visuals  to  aid  in 
learning is another form of great technological use. Top institutions around the world, now rely on the use 
of  amazing  PowerPoint  presentations  and  projections  in  order  to  keep  the  learning  interactive  and 
interesting. Technological use such as projectors within the schools and colleges can take the interaction 
and interest levels right up and also improve motivation. Students like seeing appealing visuals, rather than 
just reading words, and they like to think. In technology, the learning part is also quite efficient [6].

Header: Digital footprint in the education sector 
The  digital  media  penetration  in  the  education  sector  has  now  increased  when  it  comes  to  digital  and 
education. Such exposure has culminated in interactions with students throughout the clock and numerous 
channels accessible for various types of assignments or assistance. When digital technology increases, more 
apps are accessible that help students grow and learn [7].

Digital ratings are now a very common phenomenon. People want to take online courses and certifications. 
Top institutions deliver excellent online programs leveraging different applications and the internet [8]. The 
idea  will  continue  to  grow  as  more  awareness  and  knowledge  are  acquired.  For  students  working  and 
searching for accessible classes, the online degree scenario around the world is more popular.

In education, the role of technology is fourfold: it is included as part of the curriculum, as a delivery system 
for  instructional  purposes  and  also  as  an  instrument  to  improve  the  entire  process  of  learning.  Via 
technology, curriculum has been passive, reactive and violent.  In corporate  and academic environments, 
education is essential. In the previous, preparation is used to assist staff to do things differently from before. 
In the latter, research is  aimed at creating students ' interest.  In any situation, utilizing technologies will 
enhance the interpretation and learning of concepts.

Header: Factors affecting technology in education 
Jung talks about the huge challenges that teachers face in our society as knowledge is rapidly expanding. 
Modern technologies allow teachers to know how these technology are to be used in their schooling. It raises 
teacher training demands with these new technologies. Gressard and Loyd (1985) confirmed that instructor 
machine behaviors are key to the success of ICT implementation in school. They found out that teachers do 
not always have positive views about technology and their negative attitudes will contribute to computer 
based tasks becoming ineffective. 

Impact of ICT on education 

In educational context, ICT has the potential to increase access to education and improve its relevance and 
quality. Tinio (2002) asserted that ICT has a tremendous impact on education in terms of acquisition and 
absorption of knowledge to both teachers and students through the promotion.

Technology can have a positive effect on schooling and can have negative effects at the same time. Teachers 
and students should use this in good light to eliminate the drawbacks that many pupils and schools face in 
pursuing  excellence.  Therefore,  it  is  time  for  any  nation  to  develop  an  educational  system  of  greater 
technological capacity in the future.

Performance, productivity, management, policy, manpower, human resources, marketing, 
and sales are some of the areas where the effects of technology on businesses have been 
listed in the literature review section. It also describes the motivations for the technology's 
introduction and the potential challenges a company may experience as a result of using the 
technology.

The goal of this study was to determine how the introduction of technology affected various 
business processes. The paper also examines the opportunities and threats presented by 
the widespread use of emerging technologies in the corporate world. It also examines the 
most popular technologies used by companies. 

This study employed a quantitative research strategy and a questionnaire to gather data in 
order to accomplish its goals. The data was then analysed in Microsoft Excel. 

The outcome of the data analysis indicates that technology has a massive impact on all 
company operations, significantly on marketing and promotion. There is a widespread 
reliance on mobile phones and social media networking for business purposes. While the 
introduction of new technologies allows businesses to expand rapidly, it also raises the 
possibility of the theft of confidential data.

INTRODUCTION 

1 

Technology refers to the process through which a scientific notion is put into action in the real 

world of trade or industry, as well as to the body of instruments and other implementations 

created by a specific culture. Technology already exists, and it will only become better as we 

move forward. We must first comprehend business technology in order to grasp the function 

technology performs in today's enterprises. Technology for business includes the 

combination of computers and communication systems to assist administrative tasks 

(Meshack and Prusty, 2021). In today's business world, new developments in technology are 

happening all the time. A successful firm cannot function without the use of business 

technology. Technological innovation inside an organization used to be the exclusive domain 

of highly trained specialists who were confined to the basement and had difficulty proving 

their worth in terms of a company's bottom line. However, things have changed. We can 

clearly see how technology has become more widespread in all aspects of the company, and 

how technology's dependence on the business has risen. Boardroom technology should now 

be a continual concern because of the rise of the internet.  

Rather of being decided by IT staff, business leaders directly influence and make decisions 

around 60 percent of all technology spending. It is fair to argue that contemporary firms 

fortunes rise, and fall based on their clever or incorrect technological decisions. 

Technological innovation has now permeated every aspect of business, and CEOs can attest 

to the fact that they now have better tools for making informed choices and that it has 

become an essential part of how their companies operate on a daily basis. So, it comes as 

no surprise to those who are aware that the correct technology, paired with timely 

implementation, may help a firm not only address business issues but also strengthen its 

competitive position. Idealists like Wal-Mart and FedEx have utilized technology not merely to 

address logistical issues but also to grasp new possibilities, develop new lines of distribution, 

and build new business models that their rivals have been obliged to embrace. Technology 

was used by Wal-Mart to gain a competitive advantage in supply chain management 

(Banker, 2022).  

Rather than automating company procedures, FedEx turned to the possibilities provided by 

technology to control the scope of its expansion (Preet, 2021).   When FedEx first introduced 

 
 
 
 
 
2 

its Super Tracker, it was a major factor in decreasing the number of extra dispatchers it 

needed to recruit (Technological Innovation at FedEx, n.d.). In these situations, the 

fascinating factor is that these corporations put their money into completely new tech. 

Furthermore, none of these breakthroughs was carried out during a period of extreme 

financial plenty. Large investment by FedEx even in a strong economy was a brave move. 

Despite this, few organizations are willing to take on such large-scale projects today. It's 

possible to list a number of explanations for this. One of the factors is the current economic 

situation. While it is fair for firms to concentrate on decreasing expenses when circumstances 

are tough, it is not a good strategy in the long run. 

IT applications and technology have been used since the 1990s. ICT applications such as 

electronic commerce (e-commerce) and ERP have become essential for businesses to 

survive and prosper in recent years. Firms were driven to look for ways to boost their 

competitiveness due to the increasing competition. Only a few studies have looked at the 

connection between manufacturing and e-commerce. With e-commerce, businesses may 

lower their operating costs and increase their profits. Because of this, it may be used in the 

manufacturing of products and services. All the applications a business needs may be found 

in ERP, which is an all-in-one system. As a result, businesses are able to make decisions 

more quickly and adapt to changes in the market more quickly (Maditinos, Chatzoudes, and 

Tsairidis, 2011). 

There are two types of people in the global economy: those who create and those who 

consume. A company would not exist or be profitable without the interaction between these 

two groups. Just as consumers rely on producers to fill their wants, producers rely on them to 

fulfil their requirements. There are markets where manufacturers offer their products, and 

customers go there to acquire their requirements. Since the beginning of a business, when 

technology was still in its infancy, there have been many instances of this. The development 

of business systems is impacted by advancements in technology. Information technology is 

transforming so quickly that it is impossible to keep up. In addition to enhancing the quality of 

life for individuals, advances in information technology also help to fuel global commerce. 

Goods and services that used to be costly and time-consuming may now be completed in a 

matter of days. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
3 

One way that IT plays a part in the world of internet commerce is through providing media 

services like the internet. A place for customers to choose the products they desire is 

provided via websites and applications. Additionally, these activities need additional 

technologies to assist the internet company, including telephone connection technology, 

banks that permit customer payment, media providers, and transportation agencies like the 

post office. For both manufacturers and customers, internet commerce is wonderful because 

of the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and speed with which it can be done online. 

 The impact of information technology on human lives cannot be overstated. Social and 

technological advancements are influencing the growth of information technology. People 

that perceive commercial prospects in the growth of information technology, such as internet 

business, use it extensively. It is only a matter of time until global internet commerce 

becomes the norm. A lot of people use them on a regular basis, and they have done well. 

Online businesses make it easier for customers to receive the products and services they 

need. An important factor in the growth of e-commerce in various nations is the availability 

and accessibility of low-cost internet connections. 

Technological progress is important and supportive of business operations, but it does not 

come cheaply; in addition, facilities in the region or location where the firm conducts business 

activities should be used to promote technological advancement. 

ICT advancement has a huge influence on several parts of life, especially in the business 

sector. Changes in the way businesses are conducted are becoming increasingly prevalent 

across the world, and these changes are primarily focused on providing the information and 

extensive network systems needed to provide quicker and more dynamic accessibility. The 

world of business must be able to respond to customer demand for products and services 

immediately because of the high mobility of people. The media Internet is increasingly being 

used by business organizations to link sellers and buyers in order to facilitate transactions. 

As Deans and Kane (1992) discovered, IT is crucial to a company's performance in the face 

of economic uncertainty and volatility. In various regions of the globe, academics have looked 

at how the rise of IT has influenced start-up culture.   

The study focuses on finding the impact of technology on business activities. The intention is 

to examine how technology affects core business processes including marketing, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

management, supply chain and human resources. The transformations in technology as well 

as the problems that are associated with the use of technology are another concerning 

aspect of the study. To accomplish the study's goal, survey information was gathered from a 

group of 28 persons who work in various industries. The study's findings will aid 

organizations in understanding the effects of technology and the challenges associated with 

incorporating it into their operations. That way, they'll have the information they need to 

properly use the technology and address any problems associated with doing so. 

Modern society is equally shaped and determined by digital technology and information. 

When comparing the business risks of two similar companies, one that is technology-

dependent often has higher risks. Many different kinds of research on the impact of IT may 

be found in the scholarly literature. As an example, Bailey (1989) said that computers and 

other technology are now universal in all spheres of society, including commerce, industry, 

finance, education, and government.  

The phenomenon of entrepreneurship has been studied extensively, and several variables 

have been found to influence its prevalence. Entrepreneurial people, for instance, typically 

exhibit multiple personality traits simultaneously, including originality, a willingness to take 

risks, the initiative in carrying out the steps required to implement one's ideas, and the 

willingness to accept full accountability for the results of one's endeavours, whether they 

succeed or fail (Morris and Sexton, 1996). 

 Products and services, markets, product costs, and product distinctiveness are all impacted 

by a company's information technology infrastructure. Therefore, the adoption and innovative 

use of IT are crucial to the success of forward-thinking businesses. In order to facilitate long-

term growth and prosperity social entrepreneurship and IT is a powerful tool for sustainable 

progress (M Pearce, Grafman and Colledge, 2008). 

These findings are significant because they apply a business model viewpoint when looking 

at how new technology may affect corporate innovation efforts in the future. Maintaining 

innovation in this way enables a more dynamic perspective of technology effect and a more 

proactive understanding of how people launch various courses of action. Some claim that 

ICT has the capacity to bring about the greatest technological revolution in the history of 

humanity. Snow published research in which he expressed an optimistic perspective on the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

influence of information and communication technology (ICT) nearly fifty-five years ago 

(Snow, 1966). 

Furthermore, this report combines the influence of information and communications 

technology (ICT) usage on company performance, while earlier analysis solely looked at the 

impact of IT use on business performance, ignoring information exchange tools. Research on 

ICT usage and business performance tends to focus on determining whether or not ICT use 

has an impact on business outcomes. Nonetheless, this analysis also attempts to answer the 

question "when, where, and how can information and communications technology (ICT) 

affect business performance?" by classifying all business activities and analysing the effect of 

technology usage on business activities. 

 
 
 
 
 
2  THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 

6 

An organization or thing that makes a profit by selling products or services is a business. This 

definition's  key  point  is  that  a  business  is  anything  that  runs  in  order  to  generate  a  profit. 

Although not all firms are profitable enough to do so, making money is their primary goal. 

Humans' demands and interests are ever-expanding as they evolve as individuals. Humans 

must thus look for a system that provides rewards in order to satisfy the impulses of people to 

succeed individually rather than just giving and taking. To some extent, the enterprise system 

becomes a mechanism for attaining material well-being. The business now has a strong link 

with the corporation, which is an organization that operates only for the benefit of its 

members, resulting in high earnings. There is a distinct division of labour inside a corporation 

that is organized in this way. Managers and staff are the terms used to describe those in 

charge of enforcing corporate regulations (Mgunda, 2019). 

2.1  E-business 

E-business is a business system that uses digital media, such as radio and television. In light 

of the fact that the internet is now widely accepted as a medium for e-business, the general 

public is under the impression that it is an internet-based business model. E-business is 

evolving as new electronic gadgets like smartphones and tablets become more widely 

available (Shaqiri, 2015).  

Because the internet can be accessed wirelessly on mobile devices such as smartphones 

and tablets, new methods such as the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) may be 

developed, allowing people to utilize the internet whenever and wherever they choose. 

Electronic networks and related technologies may be used to allow, optimize, enhance, alter, 

or originate a business process or business system to produce higher value for present or 

future consumers. In general, the concept makes it evident how electronic and digital 

technology may be used as a channel to achieve business operations and systems 

(exchanges of products and services) that are far superior to those achieved using traditional 

techniques, particularly when considering the advantages that can be perceived by people 

involved (stakeholders) (Indrajit, 2007). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 

2.2  Business technology 

Business technology works to maximize the use of technology within the company in order to 

meet the requirements and desires of the consumers. Through the use of automation, 

efficiency is increased while time is conserved. Furthermore, as users may already be aware, 

time equals money. This means it saves money in the long term. Let us phrase it this way to 

give a sense of the significance of technology in business. When it comes to business 

technology, the goal is always to improve collaboration within and between companies. 

Technology like video chat programs and other forms of online teamwork software fall under 

this category. Furthermore, incorporating cutting-edge technology can strengthen the safety 

of the system. The broad word "business technology" refers to the use of and incorporation of 

IT into business processes. Integrating technology into a company setting is more than just 

having an IT staff. Management procedures, organizational framework, resources, and the 

regulation of technology are all part of this. All are aimed at making business more efficient 

by making better use of technology (Sahana, 2022). 

It is hard to conceive of a thriving enterprise that doesn't use technology in some capacity. 

Business needs the strength of business technology if it wants to boost efficiency, provide 

superior goods and services, keep track of sales and assets, and advertise successfully. The 

term "business technology" refers to a strategy for centralizing and standardizing the 

administration of technological resources within an enterprise. It is a set of procedures and 

practices for running a business that uses technology to its advantage in order to better 

satisfy the needs of its customers. In order to better serve their customers and keep up with 

market demand, most businesses know they must constantly push not only their rivals but 

also themselves. Since then, many efforts have been made to "contain" IT by putting it under 

the supervision of IT departments and keeping costs in check. 

Today's IT departments should work with other sections of the business to share their 

knowledge and embrace customer-focused, revenue-generating, and product-development 

practices from other areas of the organization. This is not a one-way street; for example, 

marketing teams need to take advantage of the technology management tools at their hands 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 

to prevent cost overruns and the implementation of solutions that are incompatible with the 

rest of the organization's environment (Janani, 2021). 

Ahead is a summary of the most widely used forms of technology in business today, all of 

which can facilitate the transition from more archaic to more advanced techniques. Many 

businesses today rely heavily on computers. They can do tasks like analyse financial data, 

communicate via email, and create sales slideshows all with the help of software. They can 

get this computer in two forms: a stationary desktop and a mobile notebook. Computers 

require various kinds of software, such as apps and running information, in order to carry out 

particular tasks. Businesses commonly use Microsoft Word, a text processor, and Microsoft 

Excel, a financial accounting program. Sales slideshows can also be made in a matter of 

minutes using presentation software like Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote. Customized 

software developed specifically for an organization's needs is widely used (What is business 

technology?). 

Networking is the practice of collaborating with groups of people to exchange and 

disseminate resources, such as files, data, and communications. It also allows multiple 

computers to share the same printer or file device. It is possible for a network to link only 

machines in a single workplace, or it could span multiple locations. In order to grow and 

attract new customers, businesses require the opportunity to network with others in related 

industries. The most modern computers are part of some sort of network and use an internet 

connection to carry out their duties. Wireless networks can also be used to link printers to 

computers so that they can receive printing instructions. Companies can benefit greatly from 

establishing and utilizing networks because it facilitates the free flow of data and papers 

among workers. With a network, multiple devices can share one printer or one hard drive. It's 

possible that a network is restricted to machines within a single building. The network's 

spread determines how far it can reach, which could be the complete office or just a single 

floor (Janani, 2021). 

Workers are able to keep in touch with one another about their day-to-day activities and 

ongoing initiatives via mail and phone networks. However, in some progressive companies, 

top executives are provided with company-issued smartphones in addition to their in-house 

"line" phones. Auto operators are a common feature of modern business phone systems, and 

they direct calls to the appropriate department or individual. When an employee is not in the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
9 

office, their recording can play a personalized message. Similarly, to internal phone 

networks, email systems are typically only accessible within an organization and may be 

incompatible with third-party applications. Building business connections calls for clear and 

concise expression of ideas. As a consequence, companies rely on the telephone to 

communicate with their clients and other entities. This facilitates speedy, effective, and 

individual interactions with clients. Long-term success and growth can be achieved through 

solid client care and open lines of communication within the company's workforce. These 

days, businesses can choose from a variety of feature-rich industrial telephone systems 

(Business Technology - Definition &amp; Overview). 

Financial transactions can be recorded and analysed with the help of a bookkeeping system. 

QuickBooks has found its largest customer base among small companies. It is simple to 

implement and keep running. On the other hand, larger corporations often employ SAP 

Business One or Sage Accpac, two accounting software options that provide greater 

adaptability and interoperability. Each company's scale and specific requirements will dictate 

the best bookkeeping solution for their business. Consult bookkeeper about the options 

available before making any final choices. When it comes to managing the company's salary, 

financial bookkeeping software is invaluable. An organization's accounting system can be 

used to watch income and forecast future cash amounts, among other functions. By keeping 

track of all business transactions, accountants can reduce the likelihood of theft and 

guarantee timely payments to all employees (Emma, 2019). 

A company's entire stock can be managed with the help of an inventory management 

system. It maintains precise logs of product information, such as supply levels and sales 

data, and automatically adjusts for new arrivals and depletions. Businesses need a sufficient 

and orderly method to handle their inventory in order to maintain a stable stock level, know 

what they have on hand, and analyse their financial standing (Emma, 2019). 

A customer relations management (CRM) system makes it possible to track a customer's 

relationship with a business. As soon once a client's data is obtained, the CRM will start 

keeping track of any subsequent interactions with that client. When a customer calls in to 

place an order, ask for help, or have a technical question answered, the service 

representative can look up the customer's information in the CRM system to see when the 

order was shipped, what is on backorder, and what other interactions the customer has had 

 
 
 
 
 
 
10 

with your company. A CRM is a database that keeps tabs on customers and their interactions 

with a business. A client relationship management system starts recording data about a 

prospect as soon as they are identified as a possible buyer. When a client places a purchase 

over the phone, the CRM software alerts the appropriate departments as to which products 

need to be shipped and to which address. The CRM serves as a communicator between the 

client and the staff, keeping everyone up to date on the order's development at all times. If an 

object is out of stock, the CRM will alert the buyer and prevent the purchase from being 

placed. Relationships with consumers can be strengthened through the use of customer 

relationship management systems, which collect and analyse data about each client to help 

businesses provide superior service (What is business technology?). 

2.3  Reasons for the introduction of technology 

A variety of factors influence an organization's decision to use new technology. Some of 

these factors are, In order to boost outputs, to improve the product, to lessen reliance on 

specialized labour, to keep up with the latest trends and developments, new technology is 

being introduced by other organizations as well, exciting to see how technology evolves and 

to alter the power of dynamics inside the company (Yee and Oh, 2012). 

It is possible that individuals in charge of justifying new technology investments won't 

acknowledge all of these reasons, but research has still uncovered them. Computer and 

technology prices and performance have been falling at an exponential rate, which is 

frequently cited as another rationale for continuing to invest in new technologies. 

Increasingly, as the internet has grown and economies and industries have become more 

globalized, businesses have been investing more money into technology. According to the IS 

literature, organizations throughout the world should use information technology (IT) to 

improve their operational management and coordination while also opening up new 

worldwide marketplaces and enterprises (Ives and Jarvenpaa, 1991).  

These reasons have fuelled the continuous investment in new technology by organizations. If 

a company is functioning in international markets but is failing to manage its business 

globally in a globally integrated way and maintain tight control over its global activities, the 

company will be at a significant strategic disadvantage. With the help of technology, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 

organizations are able to manage and control ever-more complicated and worldwide 

operations with more precision than before (Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1989). Some common 

reasons for adopting technology in business are described ahead. 

Particularly among technological applications, e-commerce, and e-business stand out. The 

importance of technology can be evaluated along two dimensions: the creation and 

refinement of fundamental norms and the attainment of a competitive edge along the value 

chain. Many issues related to the successful completion of technology projects and the 

problems that can arise during their implementation have been analysed. The results of an 

information system or an innovation proposal are judged on their success or efficacy based 

on how well they meet the needs of the business and how close they come to achieving the 

company's stated objectives. Although this issue can be addressed acceptably, there is 

widespread consensus that it is difficult to discover evidence of the benefits of investment in 

technology (Smithson & Hirschheim, 1998).  

In order to make the most of these resources, businesses must conduct an evaluation of the 

technology's efficacy, which will allow for the strategic alignment of the goals of the app 

technology and outcomes with the company's business vision. Because the firm situation is 

constantly changing to consider market facts and trends, the distinction and evaluation of 

business and technological plans as well as between business and technological structure 

must be ongoing processes. Inside and outside the organization, technology has been 

viewed as a potential replacement engine (Brynjolfsson& Smith, 2000).  

The low-cost processing and trading of large quantities of information online have far-

reaching implications for the organizational structure of businesses and marketplaces. Some 

scholars in the field of technology set out to determine what role technology plays, if any, in 

determining whether or not an organization's financial dealings are aligned with those 

occurring outside of it. This is because the company is more likely to have a suitable fit for 

the procedure than the market would be. Complexity is another hallmark of business 

processes. Internal reorganization is more likely to take place in a business where processes 

are more involved. Technological advancements can have an effect in both of these fields. 

Suppose an internal economic procedure is modified because of the high-benefit precision 

and complicated data-processing actions required by the technology. Companies will be able 

to increase the alternative worth of the advantage outside the relation and decrease the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
12 

danger of being "frozen "in the relation ex-post if they implement information systems that 

facilitate flexible manufacturing activities. In a similar vein, the complexity of the job will be 

diminished by the use of automated production processes and big datasets with inquiry 

capabilities. There will be a shift toward a market-based modification of proceedings that had 

previously been changed internally by the company. Technology represents a potentially 

more productive economy in this regard. After providing a broad overview of how technology 

will affect the framework in which economic activity takes place, academics have examined 

whether markets have grown more fruitful as a consequence of technology. Information 

asymmetry can cause market errors, but technology can help level the playing field by 

making it cheaper to discover information (Berliant et al., 2002). 

Companies, whether using outsourcing or another method, must determine how to describe 

the processes they "export" to remote locations while ensuring that those operations continue 

to function seamlessly within the context of the overall business. In this sense, technology 

serves a dual purpose. On the one hand, the rapid exchange of a great deal of data 

facilitates real-time collaboration between departments and teams within a company. The 

approach of changing work across many locations is feasible and effective due to the 

dramatically declining costs of communication. However, technology and the mechanization 

process necessitate that a company's internal processes be clearly specified, monitored, and 

controlled. A large-scale, company-wide effort at computerization often has "presence" as 

one of its primary goals, especially in big organizations. When it comes to organizing, 

describing, and considering the ad hoc and poorly organized processes upon which work is 

built, information systems can be restrictive because they implement specific methods of 

doing tasks (Economides & Flyer, 2000). 

Some academics, like Sassen, have made it their life's work to analyse the effects of the 

"death of distance" on everything from organizational structures to people's overall 

worldviews. Computers and the Internet are indispensable tools for remote management, as 

they allow for the identification of the most efficient distribution of workers across geographic 

regions, as well as the demonstration of this allocation's effectiveness, all while keeping the 

company's operations running smoothly. With the advent of such computer-based systems 

and the dramatic reduction in their costs, it is commonly hypothesized that businesses will 

eventually be able to "liberate" themselves from the tyranny of location. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
13 

Although economists have known for a long time that position choices have unintended 

consequences, location economics has only recently begun to address this issue. For this 

reason, financial factors form the basis of gathering models in "new economic geography" 

trends. Customers who place a premium on flexibility in how they put a product to use, highly 

bold businesses with a penchant for making unique offerings, a rise in the proportion of 

small-scale solutions to large-scale problems, and rising transportation costs are all 

characteristics of these trends. An intriguing explanation for the rise in business and national 

output can be found in the presence of factors linked to location models. A production 

function with labour, capital, and an extra word representing total factor output is proposed by 

standard growth models in economics. There are two ways in which these models define 

progress: internally, through changes to the system's resuscitation options, and outwardly, 

through changes to the system's overall parameter output. Productivity growth not explained 

by input growth is assumed to be defined by replacements in neoclassical growth models like 

the Solow and Swan models (Brynjolfsson& Smith, 2000). 

2.4  Changes in technology 

Technology is developing quickly and in many different ways; it currently permeates many 

facets of daily life. New technologies make it easier and more efficient to deal with a wide 

range of issues. As technology covers such a wide range of topics, it's difficult to put it into 

neat little boxes. The core of technological advancement may be broken down into four 

categories: the computer industry, the transportation and communication industry, the energy 

and natural resources industry, and the new manufacturing process industry. The company's 

internal performance is influenced by technological advancements in the computer industry, 

particularly in administration. By using a database system, businesses may categorize their 

information with great depth and accuracy. It is possible to utilize this method to track staff 

absences as well. Inventory gathering in businesses relies heavily on the database system. 

Rather than reducing job prospects, the rising complexity of computers has the opposite 

effect, since most major businesses today need computer professionals in data collecting, 

informatics (programming), and of course computer specialists. This is due to the significance 

of the availability of technology resources that the organization uses to support its operations 

(Issa-Salwe, Ahmed, Aloufi and Kabir, 2010). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 

Many businesses are outfitting their equipment, shipments, infrastructure, gadgets, and even 

personnel with networked sensors and actuators so they can monitor their surroundings, 

report their status, receive orders, and respond depending on the data they collect. The term 

"the Internet of Things" refers to this concept. When these organizational resources are 

tracked in real-time, businesses may better manage the flow of activities and minimize 

interruptions by responding to issues as they develop and adopting preventative measures 

(McNall and Stanton, 2010). Employee productivity is positively impacted by today's 

computers' capacity to solve complicated tasks. Computers have made it a lot easier and 

faster to deal with a wide range of variables that would have taken a long time to address 

manually. The development of a wide range of analytical applications is also helping. There is 

a wide range of applications available that may be tailored to meet the specific demands of 

different types of businesses (Cascio and Montealegre, 2016).  

It is also an advantage to have safe storage and backup. The computer is error-free, so 

there's no need to be concerned about missing information. The movement of products inside 

a corporation is made easier by advancements in transportation technologies. There is a 

wide range of options accessible, including land, sea, and air-based services. The 

transportation budget is now one of the items to consider because of the growing costs and 

pace of development. When compared to air travel, land transport has a lower overall cost. 

There are several advantages to using air transportation, but they aren't worth the price and 

size of the cargo. The internet's rise has made communication easier to access, shifting the 

presence of technologies. It is now the norm to use email services that are simple, 

economical, and full of features. Since more and more people are using the internet on a 

daily basis, it is a great marketing tool. In addition, networks make it easier for workers and 

the board of directors to communicate with one another. They are more important than ever 

since they may have a big influence on building the bond between two people. In addition to 

the internet, television, and radio continue to be the primary mediums of mass 

communication that businesses rely on and promote. There are now more diversified and 

high-quality TV shows that include the interests of particular groups (Mgunda, 2019).  

2.5 

Impact of technology on performance and productivity 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15 

Even though many businesses have made technological investments in the hopes of cutting 

expenses and boosting output, the literature is divided on whether or not these goals have 

been met. Concerning the amount of productivity brought about by information technology, 

the existence of a "productivity paradox" has been the subject of much debate. To put it 

another way, there is evidence to show that, despite years of massive investment in IT, the 

rate of measured productivity growth has remained flat or even declined. Since productivity is 

measured in terms of output per unit of input, and since computers are themselves an input, 

the first question to address is under what circumstances increased computer intensity would 

be expected to increase productivity (Lehr and Lichtenberg, 2003). Rapid and successful 

integration of new software systems appears to be expensive. Each workstation at Microsoft 

costs $16,000 per year to maintain and upgrade in 1999 (Parasuraman, Valarie and Berry, 

1999). A common misconception is that changing how work is done may also result in cost 

savings. However, the counterclaim that computers and software are productive increases is 

supported by data. "Futzing" is defined as the time users spend in a bewildered condition 

cleaning up inexplicable events and overcoming the uncertainty and alarm when computers 

create ambiguous signals that cease functioning (Strassman, 1997). Recent years have seen 

an uptick in the amount of research that investigates the IT return, which is indicative of the 

difficulty in determining the existence of a productivity conundrum. We may not be able to 

accurately gauge productivity increases from computers, which is a common rebuttal to the 

productivity paradox argument. However, before the benefits of computers can be fully 

realized, it is possible that significant modifications in supplementary infrastructure (such as 

human and knowledge capital and the global communications infrastructure) would be 

required (David, 2008). 

2.6 

Impact on quality 

A systematic empirical study is needed to determine the proportional importance of service 

excellence, product quality, and price in the evaluation process. Achieving a lasting economic 

edge in the market with just better goods and affordable costs, however, appears to be 

extremely challenging, according to case studies and personal evidence This finding is based 

on the fact that, unlike product quality and price, service quality is much more difficult for 

rivals to successfully replicate. Initial studies indicated that consumers evaluate service 

quality by contrasting the vendor's real performance with their own mental image of what the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
16 

seller should provide. An in-depth research study corroborated this picture of service quality 

and provided additional support by identifying several distinct characteristics that consumers 

may use to evaluate the expectations-performance difference (Parasuraman et al., 1985). 

Leaning on the results of this study and other observational studies from a variety of fields, 

there are five overarching factors that consumers use to evaluate a company's performance. 

Dependability: the capacity to deliver the promised service dependably and accurately. 

Responsiveness: The readiness to aid customers and deliver service promptly. The tangibles 

include the appearance of the company's actual buildings, tools, people, and communication 

materials and the intangibles include the knowledge and politeness of workers, and their 

ability to install faith and confidence. In the eyes of today's business managers and engineers 

alike, CAD is merely an instrument to help engineers in the planning process. In the same 

way that engineering sketches have traditionally represented tangible forms, CAD employs 

computer technology and a graphical representation to do the same thing. Components can 

be displayed, their dimensions and shapes illustrated, potential connections between 

components depicted, and deformations under defined pressures shown. Once the design is 

finished, the engineer can inspect it from various angles by using a printer to create sketches. 

Because of this capacity, engineers can save a lot of time and prevent common errors during 

research and design. It speeds up production and cuts down on planning time, which in turn 

speeds up distribution and boosts quality. Producing physical products is not the only use for 

computer-aided design (CAD) software. Although services themselves do not take up any 

real space, the machinery, and buildings that bring them into doing. The CAD system's 

dynamic image features could be used to depict the physical qualities of, say, the repair bays 

in an automobile center or the chambers in an emergency medical center. No matter whether 

a business' primary options are items or services, providing high-quality support is crucial to 

long-term success (Berry, 1999). 

2.7 

Impact on customer satisfaction 

As one of the most important underlying attitudes that can shape consumer decisions, 

customer happiness has long been a focus of academic inquiry in the field of marketing. 

Researchers in the field of marketing have relied heavily on the disconfirmation theory to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17 

analyse customer happiness. It posits that when people evaluate how a product performs in 

contrast to their expectations, they experience a sense of happiness (Oliver & Swan, 1989).  

Despite widespread academic backing for the disconfirmation theory, it has proven 

challenging to reliably apply across industries and product types. Several methods have been 

used to calculate customer happiness. In particular, Giese and Cote compiled meanings of 

happiness from earlier works in the field of marketing. They argued for the creation of 

context-specific happiness metrics and critiqued the lack of agreement surrounding the 

factors that contribute to contentment and the satisfaction concept. These methods, as 

opposed to measuring dissatisfaction, focus on the customer's emotive or emotional reaction 

to determine whether or not the customer is satisfied with the product or service. User 

happiness is a similar concept that has been used in the study of information systems. From 

a marketing perspective, an online store is just another kind of business, and to increase 

sales, you should focus on things like faster shipping and a more professional appearance. 

Satisfaction in brick-and-mortar shops may be influenced by factors that are less important in 

virtual stores, such as customer service and store ambiance.  

E-commerce-related information systems study has adopted measures of customer 

happiness with computer systems and data to evaluate their experiences shopping online. 

Consumers are viewed through the lens of an information systems consumer in this model, 

with the primary emphasis being placed on the quality of the online experience. It ignores, 

however, concerns that arise from the retail setting. Intelligent assistance, Internet 

knowledge, and input advice are just a few of the other factors that research has shown to 

increase the likelihood that a customer will be satisfied with an online shopping experience. 

According to this theory, the level of happiness an online user has with a service can be 

summed up as the disparity between their hopes and the service's real performance with 

regard to system quality and information quality. Similarly, post-adoption affirmation or 

disillusionment with regard to pre-adoption hopes and wishes may have an effect on 

consumer happiness levels (Khalifa& Liu, 2002). 

As a result, the vast majority of existing research has focused on only a narrow aspect of the 

many factors that contribute to or detract from online shoppers' overall happiness. Customers 

form lasting perceptions of a company largely based on their experiences with its customer 

service. Buyers and sellers interact face-to-face during service encounters, and researchers 

 
 
 
 
 
 
18 

have pinpointed three types of service encounters (e.g., service failure, special customer 

needs, and unprompted employee actions) as potential causes of customer satisfaction or 

dissatisfaction in the hospitality, transportation, and food service sectors. It is widely agreed 

that these interactions would have a negative impact on customers' happiness. The idea of 

tech-infused service interactions, with an emphasis on technology's ever-increasing 

importance in these types of interactions (Bitner et al., 2000). Authors have coined the term 

"self-service technology" to describe this phenomenon (SST). Many face-to-face encounters 

between retailers and consumers have given way to digital platforms thanks to the 

proliferation of web-based information systems. "Market space" refers to the "virtual world 

where goods and services reside as digital information and can be distributed via information-

based networks" on the World Wide Web. As technology has advanced, much of the human 

element previously present in exchanges between retailers and consumers has given way to 

digital mediums. In self-service technology, incidents that involve a "technology failure," 

"process failure," "poor design," or "customer-driven failure" tend to leave customers feeling 

less than satisfied, while incidents that involve a "solution to an intensified need," 

"improvement over alternatives," or "accomplishment of its intended purpose" tend to leave 

customers feeling relieved and content. Another research using ATMs found that people's 

perspectives on technology influenced their plans to use these devices (ATMs) (Curran et al., 

2003). 

Author created a classification of the factors that contribute to or detract from a shopper's 

happiness after a service interaction while buying online. Included in the classification 

created by Massad et al. are the following categories: fundamental service delivery errors, 

pre-encounter client scenarios, staff traits and behaviour, IT interaction, and confidence 

(Massad et al., 2006). In the future, author proposed, these could be used as predictors of 

happiness. Previous studies have looked at what factors influence customer satisfaction 

when evaluating online service encounters; these include the quality of the information 

provided, the efficiency of the system, the friendliness of the service providers, the ease with 

which customers can make purchases, the security of their personal information, the value 

they place on privacy, the ease with which they can make returns, and the value they place 

on saving both time and money (Massad et al., 2006). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
19 

2.8 

Impact of technology on manpower and organizational size 

Boosting organizational productivity is, as we have seen, a primary rationale for spending 

money on technology. In order to replace labour costs and save money, machines have been 

utilized for this purpose for a while. An increasing number of studies in recent years has 

examined how the spread of digital technology has affected the dimensions of businesses. 

Greater reliance on IT has been linked to lower company sizes, which suggests that IT helps 

cut down on the demand for workers (Brynjolfsson, Malone, and Gurbaxani, 1993). The 

correlation holds true across many definitions and at least four different dimensions of 

business size. Yet, they caution that the findings should not be understood to apply to all 

businesses and all historical periods. This suggests that the effects of the new technology 

take time to fully materialize, with the biggest reduction in business size occurring one to two 

years after IT expenditures. This discovery may explain why prior research has revealed little 

to no return on IT investments in the same year they were made. Put another way, 

businesses may decide to outsource the production of secondary goods and rely more 

heavily on purchased parts and services as a result of adopting IT. The logical consequence 

is that consultancies are sometimes used as a source of technical support services. It should 

go without saying that consultancies may vary in scale from a single person's effort to 

multinational conglomerates like IBM or CSC. After a lag of many years, the investment in IT 

led to a rise in the number of clerks and managers hired. Similarly, information technology 

was often seen as an augmentation of human labour, particularly white-collar work, rather 

than a threat to its existence. While some studies have shown a decline in employment, 

larger analyses, such as those conducted by the United States Congress Office of 

Technology Assessment, have shown that technology was probably providing more jobs than 

it was eliminating (Eason, 2001). 

It seems much easier to foresee how new manufacturing technology would affect a certain 

industry. Researchers created a scale to classify businesses by the degree to which their 

production used complicated technological processes. In this case, a high level of 

technological complexity suggested that machines did most of the job, while a low level of 

technical complexity showed that human hands were involved to a larger extent. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20 

2.9 

Impact of technology on human resources 

Due to the revolutionary changes that IT has brought to businesses, human capital 

management has become more important and difficult (Ball, 2001). Almost every company 

has a Human Resources Management department, which performs primarily administrative 

tasks. To lessen the burden of these tasks, some companies began to electronically 

automate them by creating and implementing IT-oriented software applications, which 

eventually led to the creation of specialized Human Resource Management Systems 

(HRMS). As a direct consequence of this shift, HRM practitioners have increasingly relied on 

IT in recent years, expanding its usage to include a broader spectrum of HRM tasks. The 

concept of electronic human resource management was initially employed in late 1990 when 

online shopping was becoming more popular among businesses (Bondarouk and Ruel, 

2008). 

E-HRM, or electronic human resource management, is a method of conducting HRM that 

makes use of e-business tools in order to improve the value of the organization's 

management by facilitating a smoother flow of information. Organizations may be able to 

effectively manage a growing number of HRM procedures as technology advances, adding to 

the pool of available information and expertise. As a result, human resource management 

experts may now serve a more strategic role in helping their companies gain a competitive 

edge. Human resource management (HRM) and information technology (IT) interact and 

overlap in many ways, and as a result, HRMS has emerged to characterize these systems 

and activities (IT). As data processing system programming matured into standardized 

procedures and packages of enterprise resource planning software, HRM became more 

intertwined with the IT sector. Since their rise to prominence in the late 1990s, they have 

evolved into HRM-supporting apps for talent acquisition, flexible benefits, training, e-learning, 

and more (Martin, Reddington and Alexander, 2012). 

A Human Resource Management System (HRMS) is a system that helps a business manage 

its employees and the data they generate. E-HRM, or electronic human resource 

management, describes the integration of technology into HR. The primary domains where 

HRM professionals have typically implemented IT skills are outlined by Martin et al (2012). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21 

HR professionals may also play a role in leading initiatives to improve company culture and 

implement necessary structural changes. Human resource is a vital area of every business, 

and a company's ability to manage this area effectively may be the difference between 

success and failure. There is little question that introducing and implementing information 

technology into HR departments is a complicated subject, with varying needs for 

implementation and impacts depending on the nature of both the technology and the 

organization's human resource management goals. Organizations may get strategic benefits 

from establishing more virtual consumer ties via the use of ICT. As a bonus, technology may 

help workers get their voices heard by increasing communication and collaboration via social 

media. Human resource management in Africa should focus on adapting to the changing 

nature of interactions between HR professionals, line managers, and workers as a result of 

the growing use of mobile technology. However, the introduction of IT to HRM operations is 

often prompted by the possibility of enhancements like faster and more efficient procedures, 

cost savings, higher customer satisfaction, more accurate data, more transparent and 

consistent processes, more information availability, and the facilitation of a shift in the role of 

HR managers. There is often a give-and-take in the design of a human resource 

management system between making full use of the solution as-is and tailoring it to meet 

specific HRM and business requirements. Human resource managers should be consulted 

throughout the system's design and development phases to help plan out workflows and 

check for usability issues. Branding the solution so that it is consistent with the image of 

human resources and the company as a whole is also important. 

Finally, in order to create a product that is useful and successful, it is crucial to do 

comprehensive testing with human resource managers. Because of this, HRM procedures 

will be greatly improved in many ways, including speed, efficiency, cost, accuracy, reliability, 

transparency, and consistency. Human resource experts are now able to make data-driven 

choices and provide consulting to other managers because of improvements in information 

technology and the widespread adoption of HRM systems. Finally, it's clear that trustworthy 

human resource management data has made it possible for human resource managers to 

take on a more consultative or strategic role. Beyond its original purpose, human resource 

management now helps with things like health and safety, employee benefits, and even job 

placement (Wachira, 2010). 

 
 
 
 
 
22 

The payroll module collects time and attendance information from employees, calculates their 

share of taxes and other deductions and produces their pay checks and tax documents on a 

regular schedule. In most cases, data is drawn from the modules for human resources and 

timekeeping in order to perform calculations for automated deposit and manual check-writing 

capabilities. This component may include pre-existing monetary management systems and 

cover all employee-related transactions. Standardized time and job-related activities are 

compiled in the work time. The more complex modules allow for a great deal of customization 

in terms of data collecting, labour allocation, and analytical tools. The major functions are 

cost analysis and efficiency measurements. The module for managing and monitoring 

employee involvement in benefit schemes is known as "benefits administration." Insurance, 

pay, stock options, and retirement plans are all examples of this. From applications until 

retirement, many more HR-related topics are covered by the HR management module. 

Selection, training, development, capability and skill management, compensation planning, 

and other associated activities are all recorded in the system, along with basic personal 

information such as names and addresses. Modern systems can scan applications and 

populate the appropriate information in a database, send out notifications to employers, and 

handle position administration and control. Recruitment, placement, appraisal, pay, and 

development are all aspects of human resource management (Adewoye and Obasan, 2012). 

One of the most common ways that human resources departments find people to fill open 

jobs is via online recruitment. Systems for managing human resources usually include 

assessing how a company makes use of its employees, finding possible candidates, using 

company-facing listings to find people to hire and advertising to both recruiters and job 

seekers, as is the case with online recruitment portals and magazines (Adewoye and 

Obasan, 2012). 

The need for a specialized Applicant Tracking System (or 'ATS') module arose in response to 

the high expense of manual recruiting tasks such as cross-posting inside and beyond general 

or industry-specific job boards and keeping a competitive exposure of vacancies. The training 

component allows businesses to manage and keep tabs on their staff's educational and 

growth opportunities. The software, which is sometimes referred to as a Learning 

Management System (LMS) if it is sold separately, helps HR keep tabs on workers' academic 

achievements and professional development while also describing the courses, books, CDs, 

and online resources that may be used to hone certain abilities. After then, classes may be 

 
 
 
 
 
given at predetermined intervals, with both students and instructional materials organized 

and tracked in one place. Advanced LMSs provide for the approval of training, budgets, and 

schedules in addition to performance management and assessment data (Al-Hamad et al., 

2022). 

23 

2.10  Impact of technology on marketing and sales 

Data analysis and decision-making in management have been completely transformed by 

technological advancements. Managers may get up-to-the-moment data on sales, marketing 

strategies, and customer relationships, all thanks to modern computer programs. Today's 

data management systems are smarter and more intricate than ever before. Managers are 

increasingly turning to internet tools in order to keep tabs on not just their own organization 

but also its rivals and the opinions of their customers through Twitter, Facebook, and other 

social media sites (Ahearne, Srinivasan and Weinstein, 2013). Sometimes, managers need 

to have one-on-one conversations with workers to relay important information or provide 

guidance on ongoing projects. This is particularly true for sales managers and other roles 

where acting is crucial because choices have a direct impact on the company's bottom line. 

These managers may now easily reach out to staff over great distances using smartphone 

apps made possible by technological advancements. Sales personnel in the field may now 

communicate with their supervisors through text, instant messaging, and email to provide 

important papers and updates. Information is perhaps the most valuable commodity in the 

modern day. Keeping this in mind, each scrap of data in the hands of a knowledgeable 

person is worth its weight in gold. The online and mobile activity provides marketers with a 

wealth of information and companies may use that information to tailor their ads to exact 

preferences and behaviour (Danaher, Wilson and Davis, 2003). 

It is important to note that data collection is not exclusive to cyberspace. Technology 

advancements like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) are enabling retailers to monitor 

customers even at brick-and-mortar locations (Parkin, 2018). Once they have that data, they 

may utilize it to fine-tune their approach to sales. Keeping tabs on all of the consumers that 

enter their businesses allows them to find the high-traffic areas and optimize their point-of-

sale advertising accordingly. The pure-play market is also evolving. Even something as 

seemingly innocuous as door-to-door salesmen may be the catalyst for profound shifts. The 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cell phones that most salesmen now carry let them know precisely which doors to knock on. 

Their tech tells them which areas customers are interested in purchasing. In addition to 

improving their odds of success, their cell phones help them save time and energy (Shugan, 

2004). 

24 

2.11  Re-engineering business process 

For significant gains in efficiency, effectiveness, and customer satisfaction, businesses often 

resort to a process known as "reengineering," which entails a complete reconsideration and 

rebuilding of their core procedures. The goal of business process reengineering (BPR) is to 

make a company more competitive by enhancing its ability to innovate and carry out its daily 

operations. BPR can get closer to its goals of client happiness, lower operating expenses, 

and improved viability by taking the following measures (Davenport, 1990). Aspirations and 

plans for the company: The first step in any BPR effort should be to formulate goals that can 

be measured. The foundation for what needs to be accomplished must be agreed upon at the 

start, in accordance with the company's vision and purpose, whether the objective is expense 

reduction, improved product quality, or increased productivity. Once an objective has been 

established, all processes must be analysed to determine which ones are "slacking" or have 

room for improvement. The "red" list includes procedures that either have an immediate 

effect on the company's production or are in direct conflict with the company's stated 

purpose. The success or failure of BPR hinges on the accuracy of this determination. 

Identification and evaluation of red procedure can be done once you have an inventory of 

processes that are dragging things down, you need to explain how they were singled out as 

problematic. No matter the nature of the problem, every procedure needs to be evaluated 

fairly in comparison to either established benchmarks in the industry or the best practices of 

responsibly sourced competitors (Davenport, 1990). 

For BPR to be successful, an effective and up-to-date IT infrastructure is required. All of the 

variables contributing to the shift cannot be monitored without such a method. It is crucial to 

put in place information systems capable of handling the scale of the change before 

beginning a drastic BPR activity (Davenport, 1990). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
25 

A working prototype is always used before releasing a final version of a product. Nothing 

should ever be adopted on a bigger scale if it has already failed during testing. One of the 

most common causes of BPR project failure is a failure to recognize and embrace testing-

stage constraints. The perspective of both management and staff towards the new method of 

operation should be evaluated (Davenport, 1990). 

The last step in finishing a project successfully is managing the transformation that the BPR 

activities will inevitably bring about. Clear transfer into the new way of working is facilitated by 

up-to-date paperwork, organizational frameworks, governance models, and revised maps of 

power and responsibility. Reengineering a business process is a once-in-a-lifetime 

endeavour that can't be redone if things don't go smoothly the first time around. The input of 

time and money into it, along with the possibility of disenchanted workers, makes it a 

potentially hazardous endeavour. Involvement and support from upper-level management are 

crucial, and the initiative's breadth of responsibility should be expansive. We must remember 

that BPR is not a guarantee of achievement. There is always a chance of failing with any 

endeavour (Davenport, 1990).  

The success of a BPR program hinges on these factors, putting the requirements of 

customers first and using this strategy to guide business decisions in the right way, a 

reduction in expenses will help the company remain competitive, all working processes are 

viewed from a strategic perspective, with pertinent questions posed about the current method 

of doing things and how it can be improved in the long run to yield more effective business 

procedures, there is an eagerness to concentrate on results rather than duties or rigid 

organizational structures. This allows for the simplification and consolidation of multiple 

processes into a smaller number of more efficient ones, there is a genuine effort to 

streamline processes by removing those that are unnecessary or produce subpar results. 

When a BPR initiative is viewed as a means to merely tweak and enhance already 

established practices, it is doomed to failure. There is no hope for achievement unless there 

is an unambiguous readiness to place every current procedure on the cutting block 

(Luenendonk, 2019). 

Neither the management nor the staff shows any signs of being committed to the company 

for the long haul. Getting people on board is challenging, and many BPR efforts fail because 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not enough time or energy is spent doing so. We are putting fewer hours into redesigning and 

more into automating. The procedure is sacrificed for the sake of one section. When striving 

for total effectiveness, a mind-set that is receptive to in-depth process analysis and ready to 

make any necessary adjustments is essential. As a result, too little attention is paid to the 

business as a whole and to the best practices of competitors (Luenendonk, 2019). 

26 

2.12  The problem of technology insertion 

It is well known that technology initiatives as a whole often collapse. Implementing a new IT 

system is not only a major undertaking, but also the most time-consuming, costly, and 

irritating aspect of any IT project (Moynihan, 1997). In a similar vein, more than half of all IT 

system development initiatives end in failure. Working with cutting-edge technology raises 

the stakes because of the multiplied repercussions of lateness, expense, and missed 

deadlines. Failures and difficulties in implementing new technologies are not exclusive to the 

information technology sector. In reality, there is evidence to imply that comparable patterns 

and failure rates exist across many other sorts of technology, not only computers but also 

telephony, materials, transportation, and biotechnologies. When looking at the particular 

causes of IT failure, a 1998 analysis of 100 aborted IT projects showed that 87% went over 

budget by more than 50%, while 45% did not provide the desired outcomes (Asante, 2013). 

However, it is fairly uncommon for IT projects to be scrapped before a final product is 

released. IT artifacts are not always utilized, and there is evidence that IT initiatives have a 

higher failure rate than any other element of a company. Multiple studies confirm that 

including IT in a project increases the level of risk, which frequently may tilt the scale toward 

project failure, instead of project success. The high rate of system failure was not frequently 

foreseen among the many early projections of technology's influence on businesses. It is 

difficult to get reliable statistics on the rate of failure, although Gibbs claims that operational 

failure is at a record high of 70% (Gibbs, 1994). 

An examination of the literature by Eason reveals, however, that "it began at approximately 

40 percent and, despite significant advancements in the technology, has stubbornly refused 

to diminish through the numerous polls undertaken over the previous 30 years (Eason, 

2001). While there are likely to be numerous differences in the success of various application 

types, one basic conclusion may be drawn: the larger and costlier the project, the greater the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
27 

likelihood of failure. In addition to complete failure, technology projects also carry the danger 

of missing their deadlines and going over budget. For instance, it's not uncommon for IT 

projects to go significantly over time and money. In a similar vein, research conducted in 

1995 indicated that just 26% of all projects involving information systems are finished on 

schedule, under budget, and with all needs met. Nearly half of all IT initiatives ended up 

costing more money, taking longer to complete, and having fewer features and functionalities 

than were promised (Legris, Ingham and Collerette, 2003).  

 
 
 
3  METHODOLOGY 

28 

The research design serves as the overall study's plan. This method of information gathering, 

and analysis will aid researchers in achieving their objectives. The amount of research that 

has been done on a topic is influenced by the type of research question and the usefulness 

of the study. The methodology of this study is intended to investigate the research issue 

rather than to assess the facts as they have been officially understood. Fewer researchers 

adhere to a critical research mindset. It takes for granted that human beings have always 

been the ones to traditionally create, generate, and perpetuate social reality (Myers, 2011). 

3.1  Research process 

It is important to note that although there are many ways to do research, they all rely heavily 

on one another as part of the larger study process. Although the steps of the research 

process may not always occur in the sequence shown below, they do follow a consistent 

general pattern (Zikmund, 2010). As seen below in figure 1, first when a problem occurs, a 

detailed definition should be done then design of the research needs to be plan. Make a 

sample test regarding to the problem for gathering the data about the solution from different 

perspectives. After gathering the data, analysing and processing of the data should be start 

so that researcher will finalise a solid conclusion and make a detailed report of the matter.

FIGURE 1. Steps of research process 

3.2  Research design 

The research design provides a structure for the study. Thus, a research design is an 

overarching strategy for implementing the study endeavour. Designing a study creates a 

framework within which data may be organized, analysed, and ultimately provide useful 

results. 

3.3  Type of research 

There are several ways that studies might be categorized. A total of four distinct forms of 

research were presented, each tailored to a different aspect of the situation (Blumberg, 

Cooper and Schindler, 2011). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
30 

3.3.1  Reporting research 

For the sole purpose of reporting, an investigation may be conducted to account for, 

summarize, or compile data for statistical purposes. In addition, it requires familiarity with and 

experience with relevant information sources and the people who control access to those 

sources. Although well-acquired data might be very useful, publishing studies do not qualify 

the study (Blumberg, Cooper and Schindler, 2011). 

3.3.2  Descriptive research 

An attempt to answer "who," "what," "when," "where," and "how" is at the heart of each 

descriptive research. The researcher tries to characterize and define a topic, often by 

developing a profile of a particular set of issues (Blumberg, Cooper and Schindler, 2011). 

The purpose of this kind of study is not to investigate the relationship between causes and 

symptoms, but rather to describe the phenomena associated with certain circumstances or 

occurrences. 

3.3.3  Explanatory research 

The objective explains to formulate a theory that is both precise and applicable to broad 

empirical claims. Explanatory research seeks to provide an explanation for the phenomena 

that were only noticed in descriptive research. The researcher makes use of theory or, at the 

very least, hypotheses to explain the factors that led to a certain occurrence (Johansson, J. 

and Sparredal, J. 2005). Department of Business Administration and Social science, Lulea 

University of Technology, Master thesis. Studies of this kind are required if it is essential to 

demonstrate that one variable determines or affects the value of other variables. 

3.3.4  Predictive research 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
31 

Predictive research has as strong a theoretical foundation as explanatory research. This 

means we may foretell an occurrence by studying the preceding symptoms and coming up 

with an explanation for it before it happens. When doing this kind of study, the term "control" 

is used to describe an expected result. However, the effectiveness of a controlled study 

depends heavily on the complexity of the phenomena and the appropriateness of the 

prediction theory. The research questions indicate that this research is descriptive. The aim is 

to find out the impact of technology on different functions of business and how they are 

influenced by it. 

3.4  Research approach 

Quantitative research is a methodology that prioritizes numerical accuracy in data collection 

and analysis. Qualitative research is the process of seeking out information that may be used 

to quantify, characterize, and provide an explanation for some aspect of our actual 

experience. Quantitative research focuses on numerical variables such as quantity and 

frequency. It is the goal of quantitative research to find relationships and patterns that are 

more easily described in numerical form than in words. Most qualitative approaches are 

exploratory in nature and use a very small sample size of participants (Ahmad and Azman 

Ali, 2003). 

As opposed to just calculating the correlation between two variables, this method is used 

when a deeper knowledge of the underlying causes and interactions at play is desired. As a 

result, the qualitative approach may help the investigator get useful insights by probing the 

process's intangible components in more depth. In this research, a quantitative approach is 

being used to achieve the objective of this study. 

3.5  Research strategies 

There are various research strategies, but they are mostly similar. Therefore, picking the best 

strategy for a given research is crucial. Methods like these are a common component of 

studies pertaining to business and management (Wedawatta et al., 2011). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
32 

Survey polls are used to gather the information that will help study teams (from choosing 

samples to questions and topics). It is an effective strategy for gathering extensive 

information from numerous sources. The selection of respondents can be based on a wide 

range of characteristics, including but not limited to gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, 

socioeconomic status, and other demographic variables. In most surveys, these inquiries 

come first (Hesse-Biber & Leavy, 2011). 

The experiment is a thorough investigation employing the general observational approach. 

Under strict, regulated circumstances, processes and events are examined. Every 

experiment follows the same fundamental principle: modify just a little portion of the testing 

procedure at a time while leaving the rest untouched. The scholar alters the rate of an 

experiment by adding a new component. Depending on the context, this may be referred to 

as a dependent variable, a control variable, or an independent variable. Dependent variables, 

on the other hand, are those that have shifted as a result of an independent variable (Novikov 

& Novikov, 2013). 

An active study is a methodical approach to investigating and finding answers to real-world 

issues. The overarching goal of this study is to incorporate intricate interactions into any and 

all societal settings. In social groups and agencies, human and health services, businesses, 

and schools, continuous rounds of planned research attempt to address issues that arise in 

particular circumstances and places, allowing for the acquisition of measures that improve 

productivity and efficacy of work. As a result, it improves participants' well-being and supports 

social and work practices (Stringer & Arago n, 2021). 

A case study is one of the most widely used research techniques in industrial marketing. The 

character of the topic may be a contributing factor. Relationships and groups that are more 

difficult to reach than, say, customer marketplaces are the study's primary focus. A case 

study provides insight into the character of events by focusing on a singular or limited number 

of things (Easton, 2010). 

As a qualitative study strategy, grounded theory is well-known. The study's overarching goal 

is to formulate a hypothesis based on the methodical accumulation and evaluation of data. Its 

unique strategy for theorizing sets it apart from other quantitative techniques. According to 

grounded theory, data collection and analysis should be ongoing processes. It paves the way 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
33 

for the presentation of unique and insightful findings that are grounded in the data, and it 

provides clearly delineated methods for analysing that data. Researchers are assured of their 

findings when they are able to point to numerous examples in the data that are consistent 

with the idea they have developed (Urquhart et al., 2009). 

Ethnography prefers subtle, culturally rich, and engaged intricate instances of qualitative 

social study; the data generated are driven by everyday encounters. It combines various field 

methods (interviews, observations, video recording, note keeping, and study of 

autochthonous literature) recorded in the participants' observation. It rests on the firm belief 

that new knowledge is generated through intensive collaboration among scientists. 

Ethnographers frequently consider data as a present from informants, complete with all the 

ramifications that imply a trade of gifts (Falzon, 2016). 

One form of surveillance research is cross-sectional investigation. The scholar monitors both 

the contact and the outcome of the study subjects at the same time. According to the addition 

and rejection factors established for particular research, participants are chosen for the study. 

The scholar evaluates the exposure and outcomes of the assignment after choosing the 

subjects. Clinical samples and community research both benefit from cross-sectional 

analyses of illness prevalence (Setia, 2016). In this study, the survey strategy is employed to 

provide answers to the research queries and achieve the study's goals. 

3.6  Data collection 

Data collection is the process of compiling precise data from numerous sources and 

evaluating it to identify trends, possibilities, and solutions to research problems, as well as to 

assess potential consequences. There are so many ways of data collection, some of them 

describe ahead. 

Open-ended, focus-focused, and survey interviews are just a few examples of the various 

interview formats. Conversational style open-ended conversations are conducted. The 

detective has the option of eliciting both factual information and the respondent's 

interpretation of events from the critical witness. In a concentrated interview, the interviewees 

are questioned for a relatively brief amount of time, say an hour, with the primary goal of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
34 

verifying facts that have already been established and avoiding borderline inquiries. The 

queries in a survey are more organized (Parsons et al., 1993). 

In this type of data gathering, the required tangible evidence, such as technical devices, 

artistic tools, etc., are witnessed or gathered by traveling to the location of the case study. 

This may entail keeping an eye on meetings, pedestrian traffic, industrial operations, classes, 

etc. Visual proof can be very helpful in expanding our understanding of a subject (Yin, 1993). 

Organizational documents, schematics, maps, and survey data from the past are all part of 

this data-gathering technique. This type of data gathering can also make use of additional 

sources of information. Data are gathered using a variety of papers, including samples, 

figures, registry and formal publications, correspondence diaries, and branch literature (Yin, 

1993). 

Questionnaire will collect data by delivering questions to users. Questionnaires can be 

disseminated in print form or electronically via email and fax. In this approach, neither the 

researcher's intentions nor biases are considered. Additionally, the survey should not be 

overly drawn out or comprehensive because these factors might discourage respondents 

from responding. The collection of data is essential to every study since it forms the study's 

foundation. There are two types of information that may be used in a study: primary and 

secondary. Primary data are those collected directly from the population of interest by the 

researcher. 

For this research, a survey was used to collect primary data. Likert scale questions were 

prepared for the purpose of collecting data. A questionnaire using a five- or seven-point Likert 

scale is called a "Likert scale question." So that the creator of the survey may gain a 

complete picture of respondents' attitudes, the scale runs from Strongly Agree to Strongly 

Disagree. There is always a middle option on a Likert scale, for individuals who feel 

ambivalent about the topic at hand. In this survey, five-point Likert questions were used, and 

it also contains some basic questions such as age, level of education and business sector. 

The research question was distributed using an online platform. A total of 28 responses were 

collected.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
35 

3.7  Data analysis 

Data analysis is a method of analysing data in order to reach conclusions that help 

researchers learn more about a range of topics. It includes processing data, which makes it 

possible to draw accurate conclusions and meet objectives. The goal of every data analysis 

project should be to get actionable insights from data and base future decisions on those 

findings. The most important element of any study is analysing the data collected. When data 

is analysed, it is summed up. In this report, Microsoft Excel is used for analysing data.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
4  FINDINGS 

36 

The study asked respondents about their demographic and social features, such as gender, 

age, and length of service to the organization and business sector. In order to better understand 

the issue at hand and find more practical solutions, a profile of the responders might be created.

Since distance education was first introduced in higher education, there has been 

controversy attached to whether it is as effective as face-to-face instruction. The 

explosion of Internet-driven instruction has only accelerated the discussion. This study 

was undertaken in a Midwestern university technology administration program, a 

bachelors degree completion program for students with an existing occupationally 

oriented associate degree. Eight-hundred eighty-five students were identified for the 

sample. A two-factor ANOVA was used to answer the first research question: Is there is a 

statistically significant difference between students grades in online classes and 

traditional face-to-face classes? Results showed no significant difference between the 

grades of online and face-to-face students. Chi-square analysis was used for Research 

Question 2: Is there a statistically significant difference between course retention in 

online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? No significant difference was found 

between course retention in online classes and face-to-face classes. Last, Research 

Question 3 was answered utilizing chi-square analysis. Research Question 3 was, Is there 

a statistically significant difference between program retention for students entering the 

program enrolled in online classes and students entering the program enrolled in 

traditional face-to-face classes? The data showed no significant difference in course 

retention of students who began the program in online courses and students who began in 

face-to-face courses. Implications for further action include recommendations for 

expansion of online courses and programs supported by the research data. Analysis of 

existing data of other online courses and programs is recommended. Recommendations 

for further research included analyzing different delivery variations and continued study 

iii

 

 
of bachelors degree completion programs. Additional recommendations consisted of 

further analysis of specific retention factors affecting students in online education, 

including factors such as age, gender, and GPA on entering the program.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

There are so many to thank for their support and help along this journey, that I ask 

forgiveness for not acknowledging everyone. First and foremost, I want to thank my 

husband, John Kelly, for his never-ending support as I forged along. I also would like to 

thank my daughters, Jennifer and Kathleen, for their understanding when I was 

distracted, and for presenting me two beautiful grandsons as part of this process.  

I would like to thank my primary advisor, Dr. Susan Rogers, as well as Peg 

Waterman, Dr. Carolyn Doolittle, and Dr. Tim Peterson, for their suggestions and 

guidance. Dr. Rogers provided more than just encouragement in some very dark times, 

and without her help, this degree would never have been completed. 

I would like to thank the administration and faculty at Washburn University for 

their help and support with this whole process. I cannot forget the faculty in the School of 

Education Ed.D. program at Baker University as well; their experiences and 

encouragement provided me with a strong foundation to complete this journey and begin 

a new one. 

Last but not least, I offer thanks for my support group: my sister, Kay, and my 

friends, Karmey, Craig, Jill, Karen, David, and Charlsie. Without their shoulders to lean 

on, I would never have completed this journey, much less started it. I thank all of you for 

your patience with my lack of availability and my moods. 

There were others of you along the way who offered words of encouragement, 

and for that, I thank you. It is not until I began this process that I realized I had such a 

large group of friends and support. For that, I will be eternally grateful.

CHAPTER ONE 

INTRODUCTION 

Historically, postsecondary education in the United States was founded on the 

principles of the European system, requiring the physical presence of professors and 

students in the same location (Knowles, 1994). From 1626, with the founding of Harvard 

University (The Harvard Guide, 2004), to the development of junior colleges and 

vocational schools in the early 1900s (Cohen & Brawer, 1996; Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), 

the higher education system developed to prepare post-high school students for one of 

three separate tiers. The college and university system in the United States developed its 

own set of structures designed to prepare students for baccalaureate and graduate degrees. 

Junior colleges were limited to associate degrees, while vocational education institutions 

offered occupational certificates. In many cases, there was inadequate recognition of the 

postsecondary education offered at junior colleges and vocational education institutions, 

resulting in the inability of students to transfer to 4-year institutions (National Center for 

Education Statistics, 2006).  

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges began to provide academic, 

vocational, and personal development educational offerings for members of the local 

communities. During this same period, junior or community colleges developed a role as 

transfer institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or 

distance, could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & 

Brawer, 1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs involved Associate 

of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Associate of Applied Science 

(AAS) degrees were developed during the 1990s. The AAS degree was granted to those 


2 

who successfully completed the majority of their college program in vocational 

education. The creation of a variety of applied baccalaureate degrees allowed students 

who had previously thought of the AAS degree as a terminal program to complete a 

baccalaureate degree (Kansas Board of Regents, 2002-2003).  

Online education also became a strategy for students to access higher education in 

the 1990s (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). The proliferation of online courses alleviated some 

of the location-bound barriers to higher education, but online education was criticized as 

less rigorous than traditional classroom-based course work by traditional academicians. 

Russell attempted to address this argument with his 1999 meta-analysis of studies dating 

from the 1920s and covering multiple delivery models, including online education. 

Russell concluded there was no statistically significant difference in student achievement 

between courses offered online and those offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

Since the development of correspondence courses in the 1920s, researchers have 

attempted to ascertain if students participating in distance education are being 

shortchanged in their educational goals. No significant difference in grades has been 

found in the majority of studies designed to address this issue. Studies analyzing online 

student retention have shown significantly lower retention for online students.  In the last 

10 years, research studies have expanded to include variations of online education. These 

include strictly online, hybrid courses, Web-assisted classroom settings, and the 

traditional higher education course offered only as face-to-face instruction (Carmel & 

Gold, 2007).  

Online education continues to proliferate at the same time the number of 

secondary students in the United States overall is projected to increase (National Center 


3 

for Education Statistics [NCES], 2006). The projected increase of potential postsecondary 

students and online postsecondary options provides opportunities for increases in online 

education programs and courses. In 2000, NCES reported that over 65% of students in 

higher education were participating in online courses. In a 2007 study, Allen and Seaman 

estimated only 16% of those enrolled in online education courses are undergraduate 

students seeking their first degree, counter to the projected increase in traditional-age 

students. The majority of enrollees in online education are adults updating or advancing 

their credentials, creating an additional educational market for colleges and universities 

seeking to expand enrollment without adding physical space (Allen & Seaman, 2007a). 

For states and localities faced with a contradictory traditional-age enrollment decrease, 

these figures present an untapped market for higher education courses and programs. 

Background 

Researchers attempted to analyze the efficacy of distance education as far back as 

the 1920s when correspondence courses were created to meet the need of students not 

willing to attend a traditional classroom-based higher education setting. A meta-analysis 

of these studies resulted in The No Significant Difference Phenomenon, reported by 

Russell (2001). The results of over 355 studies were compiled, comparing various modes 

of delivery including correspondence, audio, television courses, and the newest wave of 

computer-facilitated instruction. Following analyses of studies completed prior to 2001, 

Russell concluded there was no difference in learning between students enrolled in 

distance education and those completing courses in the traditional setting.  

Studies completed since then have provided mixed results. Summers, Waigand, 

and Whittaker (2005) found there was no difference in GPA and retention between the 


4 

online and traditional classroom. Arle (2002) found higher achievement by online 

students, and Brown and Liedholm (2002) found GPA and student retention better in a 

traditional classroom setting.  

Student retention is an integral part of the student achievement conversation and 

is an issue for all forms of higher education. Degree-seeking students overall retention 

has been reported as less than 56% by NCES (2001). Long considered a problem in 

higher education, attention to the distance education model has shown even lower 

retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college 

setting (Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). Research on different modalities, such as fully 

online and hybrid online courses, has produced mixed results (Carmel & Gold, 2007). No 

significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities 

has been documented.  

Retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined 

students transfering from a community college. Statistics have consistantly shown a 

lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a 4-year 

university than for students who began their post-high school education at a 4-year 

institution (NCES, 2006). Townsends studies of transfer students at the University of 

Missouri-Columbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who 

had completed an AAS degree than for students beginning their education at a 4-year 

institution (Townsend, 2002). 

Occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively 

new to higher education. Transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges 

to 4-year institutions were common by the 1990s. Townsend (2001), in her study 


 
5 

conducted at the University of MissouriColumbia, observed the blurring of the lines 

between non-transferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and 

undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred. The study conducted 

by Townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their 

education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that 

grew after their completion of an occupationally-oriented degree. Laanan proposed that 

the increase in institutions offering AAS degrees necessitated new ways to transfer 

undergraduate credits (2003).  

The setting of this study is a medium-sized Midwestern campus located in 

Topeka, Kansas. Washburn University enrolls approximately 6000 students a year in 

undergraduate and graduate programs, including liberal arts, professional schools, and a 

law school (Washburn University, 2008). The Technology Administration (TA) program 

selected for the present study began in the 1990s as a baccalaureate degree completion 

program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a 

Kansas community college or through Washburns articulation agreement with Kansas 

vocational-technical schools. This program provided students who previously had 

obtained an Associate of Applied Science degree in an occupational area an opportunity 

to earn a bachelors degree. 

Peterson, Dean of Continuing Education, Washburn University, stated that in 

early 1999, Washburn University began online courses and programs at the behest of a 

neighboring community college (personal communication, April 18, 2008). Washburn 

was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students 

graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an Associate of Applied 


6 

Science degree. The TA program was among the first programs to offer the online 

bachelors degree completion option. The TA program offered its first online courses in 

Spring 2000.  

Online education at Washburn expanded to other programs and courses, to 

include over 200 courses (Washburn University, 2008). The original online partnership 

with two community colleges expanded to include 16 additional community colleges and 

four technical colleges in Kansas, as well as colleges in Missouri, California, Wisconsin, 

South Carolina, and Nebraska (Washburn University, 2008). 

An initial study in 2002 of students course grades and retention in online courses 

offered at Washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face course work (Peterson,  personal 

communication, April 18, 2008). No studies of program retention have been completed.  

In 2008, Atkins reported overall enrollment at Washburn University decreased 

6.7% from Fall 2004 to Fall 2008, from 7400 to 6901 students. During the same period, 

online course enrollment patterns increased 65%, from 3550 students to 5874 in 2007-

2008 (Washburn University, 2008). Atkins also reported that between 1998 and 2008, the 

ratio of traditional post-high school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at 

Washburn University reversed from 40:60 to 60:40. The shift in enrollment patterns 

produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the 21st century; however, 

Washburn University anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in Kansas through 

2016, based on demographic patterns of the state. The state figures are opposite the 

anticipated increase of traditional-age students nationally (NCES, 2008). The increase in 


distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditional-age 

students provided the focus for the study. 

7 

Purpose of the Study 

Online education has become an important strategy for the higher education 

institution that was the setting of this study. First, the purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students 

participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The 

second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference 

between course retention of students participating in TA online courses and their 

traditional classroom-based counterparts. The second part of the study was a replication 

of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroom-based 

instruction (Carmel & Gold, 2007; Russell, 1999). A third purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who 

began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in 

traditional face-to-face courses. The studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base 

concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree 

completion opportunities. 

Research Questions 

Roberts (2004) stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the 

structure for presenting the results of the research. The research questions guiding this 

study were: 


 
8 

1. 

Is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in 

online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

2. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates 

in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

3. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for 

students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students 

entering the program enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes? 

Overview of the Methodology 

A quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course, course retention, 

and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-face TA 

program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at Washburn 

University were utilized from comparative online and traditional face-to-face classes in 

two separate courses. In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of 885 students 

enrolled in online and traditional face-to-face courses was identified. The sample 

included students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 

and 2006 in both the online and traditional face-to-face classes. Two instructors were 

responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-to-face classes for the 

period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential 

difference in the dependent variables, course grades due to delivery method (online and 

face-to-face), instructor (instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the 

two independent variables (Research Question 1). A chi-square test for differences 

among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention (Research 

Questions 2 and 3).  


 
9 

Delimitations 

Roberts (2004) defined delimitations as the boundaries of the study that are 

controlled principally by the researcher. The delimitations for this study were 

1. 

Only data from 2002 through 2008 from Technology Administration 

online and face-to-face courses were utilized. 

2. 

The study was confined to students enrolled at Washburn University in the

higher education, attention to the distance education model has shown even lower 

retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college 

setting (Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). Research on different modalities, such as fully 

online and hybrid online courses, has produced mixed results (Carmel & Gold, 2007). No 

significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities 

has been documented.  

Retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined 

students transfering from a community college. Statistics have consistantly shown a 

lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a 4-year 

university than for students who began their post-high school education at a 4-year 

institution (NCES, 2006). Townsends studies of transfer students at the University of 

Missouri-Columbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who 

had completed an AAS degree than for students beginning their education at a 4-year 

institution (Townsend, 2002). 

Occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively 

new to higher education. Transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges 

to 4-year institutions were common by the 1990s. Townsend (2001), in her study 


 
5 

conducted at the University of MissouriColumbia, observed the blurring of the lines 

between non-transferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and 

undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred. The study conducted 

by Townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their 

education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that 

grew after their completion of an occupationally-oriented degree. Laanan proposed that 

the increase in institutions offering AAS degrees necessitated new ways to transfer 

undergraduate credits (2003).  

The setting of this study is a medium-sized Midwestern campus located in 

Topeka, Kansas. Washburn University enrolls approximately 6000 students a year in 

undergraduate and graduate programs, including liberal arts, professional schools, and a 

law school (Washburn University, 2008). The Technology Administration (TA) program 

selected for the present study began in the 1990s as a baccalaureate degree completion 

program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a 

Kansas community college or through Washburns articulation agreement with Kansas 

vocational-technical schools. This program provided students who previously had 

obtained an Associate of Applied Science degree in an occupational area an opportunity 

to earn a bachelors degree. 

Peterson, Dean of Continuing Education, Washburn University, stated that in 

early 1999, Washburn University began online courses and programs at the behest of a 

neighboring community college (personal communication, April 18, 2008). Washburn 

was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students 

graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an Associate of Applied 


6 

Science degree. The TA program was among the first programs to offer the online 

bachelors degree completion option. The TA program offered its first online courses in 

Spring 2000.  

Online education at Washburn expanded to other programs and courses, to 

include over 200 courses (Washburn University, 2008). The original online partnership 

with two community colleges expanded to include 16 additional community colleges and 

four technical colleges in Kansas, as well as colleges in Missouri, California, Wisconsin, 

South Carolina, and Nebraska (Washburn University, 2008). 

An initial study in 2002 of students course grades and retention in online courses 

offered at Washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face course work (Peterson,  personal 

communication, April 18, 2008). No studies of program retention have been completed.  

In 2008, Atkins reported overall enrollment at Washburn University decreased 

6.7% from Fall 2004 to Fall 2008, from 7400 to 6901 students. During the same period, 

online course enrollment patterns increased 65%, from 3550 students to 5874 in 2007-

2008 (Washburn University, 2008). Atkins also reported that between 1998 and 2008, the 

ratio of traditional post-high school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at 

Washburn University reversed from 40:60 to 60:40. The shift in enrollment patterns 

produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the 21st century; however, 

Washburn University anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in Kansas through 

2016, based on demographic patterns of the state. The state figures are opposite the 

anticipated increase of traditional-age students nationally (NCES, 2008). The increase in 


distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditional-age 

students provided the focus for the study. 

7 

Purpose of the Study 

Online education has become an important strategy for the higher education 

institution that was the setting of this study. First, the purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students 

participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The 

second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference 

between course retention of students participating in TA online courses and their 

traditional classroom-based counterparts. The second part of the study was a replication 

of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroom-based 

instruction (Carmel & Gold, 2007; Russell, 1999). A third purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who 

began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in 

traditional face-to-face courses. The studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base 

concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree 

completion opportunities. 

Research Questions 

Roberts (2004) stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the 

structure for presenting the results of the research. The research questions guiding this 

study were: 


 
8 

1. 

Is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in 

online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

2. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates 

in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

3. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for 

students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students 

entering the program enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes? 

Overview of the Methodology 

A quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course, course retention, 

and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-face TA 

program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at Washburn 

University were utilized from comparative online and traditional face-to-face classes in 

two separate courses. In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of 885 students 

enrolled in online and traditional face-to-face courses was identified. The sample 

included students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 

and 2006 in both the online and traditional face-to-face classes. Two instructors were 

responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-to-face classes for the 

period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential 

difference in the dependent variables, course grades due to delivery method (online and 

face-to-face), instructor (instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the 

two independent variables (Research Question 1). A chi-square test for differences 

among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention (Research 

Questions 2 and 3).  


 
9 

Delimitations 

Roberts (2004) defined delimitations as the boundaries of the study that are 

controlled principally by the researcher. The delimitations for this study were 

1. 

Only data from 2002 through 2008 from Technology Administration 

online and face-to-face courses were utilized. 

2. 

The study was confined to students enrolled at Washburn University in the 

Technology Administration program. 

3. 

Only grades and retention were analyzed. 

Assumptions 

Assumptions are defined as those things presupposed in a study (Roberts, 2004). 

The study was based on the following assumptions: 

1. 

Delivery of content was consistent between online and face-to-face 

courses and instructors, 

2. 

Course objectives were the same for paired online and traditional face-to-

face courses,  

3. 

All students enrolled in the TA program met the same criteria for 

4. 

5. 

admission to the University,  

All data entered in the Excel spreadsheets were correct, 

All students enrolled in the TA program met the same criteria for grade 

point average and program prerequisites.

CHAPTER ONE 

INTRODUCTION 

Historically, postsecondary education in the United States was founded on the 

principles of the European system, requiring the physical presence of professors and 

students in the same location (Knowles, 1994). From 1626, with the founding of Harvard 

University (The Harvard Guide, 2004), to the development of junior colleges and 

vocational schools in the early 1900s (Cohen & Brawer, 1996; Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), 

the higher education system developed to prepare post-high school students for one of 

three separate tiers. The college and university system in the United States developed its 

own set of structures designed to prepare students for baccalaureate and graduate degrees. 

Junior colleges were limited to associate degrees, while vocational education institutions 

offered occupational certificates. In many cases, there was inadequate recognition of the 

postsecondary education offered at junior colleges and vocational education institutions, 

resulting in the inability of students to transfer to 4-year institutions (National Center for 

Education Statistics, 2006).  

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges began to provide academic, 

vocational, and personal development educational offerings for members of the local 

communities. During this same period, junior or community colleges developed a role as 

transfer institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or 

distance, could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & 

Brawer, 1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs involved Associate 

of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Associate of Applied Science 

(AAS) degrees were developed during the 1990s. The AAS degree was granted to those 


2 

who successfully completed the majority of their college program in vocational 

education. The creation of a variety of applied baccalaureate degrees allowed students 

who had previously thought of the AAS degree as a terminal program to complete a 

baccalaureate degree (Kansas Board of Regents, 2002-2003).  

Online education also became a strategy for students to access higher education in 

the 1990s (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). The proliferation of online courses alleviated some 

of the location-bound barriers to higher education, but online education was criticized as 

less rigorous than traditional classroom-based course work by traditional academicians. 

Russell attempted to address this argument with his 1999 meta-analysis of studies dating 

from the 1920s and covering multiple delivery models, including online education. 

Russell concluded there was no statistically significant difference in student achievement 

between courses offered online and those offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

Since the development of correspondence courses in the 1920s, researchers have 

attempted to ascertain if students participating in distance education are being 

shortchanged in their educational goals. No significant difference in grades has been 

found in the majority of studies designed to address this issue. Studies analyzing online 

student retention have shown significantly lower retention for online students.  In the last 

10 years, research studies have expanded to include variations of online education. These 

include strictly online, hybrid courses, Web-assisted classroom settings, and the 

traditional higher education course offered only as face-to-face instruction (Carmel & 

Gold, 2007).  

Online education continues to proliferate at the same time the number of 

secondary students in the United States overall is projected to increase (National Center 


3 

for Education Statistics [NCES], 2006). The projected increase of potential postsecondary 

students and online postsecondary options provides opportunities for increases in online 

education programs and courses. In 2000, NCES reported that over 65% of students in 

higher education were participating in online courses. In a 2007 study, Allen and Seaman 

estimated only 16% of those enrolled in online education courses are undergraduate 

students seeking their first degree, counter to the projected increase in traditional-age 

students. The majority of enrollees in online education are adults updating or advancing 

their credentials, creating an additional educational market for colleges and universities 

seeking to expand enrollment without adding physical space (Allen & Seaman, 2007a). 

For states and localities faced with a contradictory traditional-age enrollment decrease, 

these figures present an untapped market for higher education courses and programs. 

Background 

Researchers attempted to analyze the efficacy of distance education as far back as 

the 1920s when correspondence courses were created to meet the need of students not 

willing to attend a traditional classroom-based higher education setting. A meta-analysis 

of these studies resulted in The No Significant Difference Phenomenon, reported by 

Russell (2001). The results of over 355 studies were compiled, comparing various modes 

of delivery including correspondence, audio, television courses, and the newest wave of 

computer-facilitated instruction. Following analyses of studies completed prior to 2001, 

Russell concluded there was no difference in learning between students enrolled in 

distance education and those completing courses in the traditional setting.  

Studies completed since then have provided mixed results. Summers, Waigand, 

and Whittaker (2005) found there was no difference in GPA and retention between the 


4 

online and traditional classroom. Arle (2002) found higher achievement by online 

students, and Brown and Liedholm (2002) found GPA and student retention better in a 

traditional classroom setting.  

Student retention is an integral part of the student achievement conversation and 

is an issue for all forms of higher education. Degree-seeking students overall retention 

has been reported as less than 56% by NCES (2001). Long considered a problem in 

higher education, attention to the distance education model has shown even lower 

retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college 

setting (Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). Research on different modalities, such as fully 

online and hybrid online courses, has produced mixed results (Carmel & Gold, 2007). No 

significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities 

has been documented.  

Retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined 

students transfering from a community college. Statistics have consistantly shown a 

lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a 4-year 

university than for students who began their post-high school education at a 4-year 

institution (NCES, 2006). Townsends studies of transfer students at the University of 

Missouri-Columbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who 

had completed an AAS degree than for students beginning their education at a 4-year 

institution (Townsend, 2002). 

Occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively 

new to higher education. Transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges 

to 4-year institutions were common by the 1990s. Townsend (2001), in her study 


 
5 

conducted at the University of MissouriColumbia, observed the blurring of the lines 

between non-transferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and 

undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred. The study conducted 

by Townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their 

education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that 

grew after their completion of an occupationally-oriented degree. Laanan proposed that 

the increase in institutions offering AAS degrees necessitated new ways to transfer 

undergraduate credits (2003).  

The setting of this study is a medium-sized Midwestern campus located in 

Topeka, Kansas. Washburn University enrolls approximately 6000 students a year in 

undergraduate and graduate programs, including liberal arts, professional schools, and a 

law school (Washburn University, 2008). The Technology Administration (TA) program 

selected for the present study began in the 1990s as a baccalaureate degree completion 

program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a 

Kansas community college or through Washburns articulation agreement with Kansas 

vocational-technical schools. This program provided students who previously had 

obtained an Associate of Applied Science degree in an occupational area an opportunity 

to earn a bachelors degree. 

Peterson, Dean of Continuing Education, Washburn University, stated that in 

early 1999, Washburn University began online courses and programs at the behest of a 

neighboring community college (personal communication, April 18, 2008). Washburn 

was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students 

graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an Associate of Applied 


6 

Science degree. The TA program was among the first programs to offer the online 

bachelors degree completion option. The TA program offered its first online courses in 

Spring 2000.  

Online education at Washburn expanded to other programs and courses, to 

include over 200 courses (Washburn University, 2008). The original online partnership 

with two community colleges expanded to include 16 additional community colleges and 

four technical colleges in Kansas, as well as colleges in Missouri, California, Wisconsin, 

South Carolina, and Nebraska (Washburn University, 2008). 

An initial study in 2002 of students course grades and retention in online courses 

offered at Washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face course work (Peterson,  personal 

communication, April 18, 2008). No studies of program retention have been completed.  

In 2008, Atkins reported overall enrollment at Washburn University decreased 

6.7% from Fall 2004 to Fall 2008, from 7400 to 6901 students. During the same period, 

online course enrollment patterns increased 65%, from 3550 students to 5874 in 2007-

2008 (Washburn University, 2008). Atkins also reported that between 1998 and 2008, the 

ratio of traditional post-high school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at 

Washburn University reversed from 40:60 to 60:40. The shift in enrollment patterns 

produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the 21st century; however, 

Washburn University anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in Kansas through 

2016, based on demographic patterns of the state. The state figures are opposite the 

anticipated increase of traditional-age students nationally (NCES, 2008). The increase in 


distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditional-age 

students provided the focus for the study.

Purpose of the Study 

Online education has become an important strategy for the higher education 

institution that was the setting of this study. First, the purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students 

participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The 

second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference 

between course retention of students participating in TA online courses and their 

traditional classroom-based counterparts. The second part of the study was a replication 

of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroom-based 

instruction (Carmel & Gold, 2007; Russell, 1999). A third purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who 

began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in 

traditional face-to-face courses. The studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base 

concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree 

completion opportunities. 

Research Questions 

Roberts (2004) stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the 

structure for presenting the results of the research. The research questions guiding this 

study were: 


 
8 

1. 

Is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in 

online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

2. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates 

in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

3. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for 

students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students 

entering the program enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes? 

Overview of the Methodology 

A quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course, course retention, 

and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-face TA 

program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at Washburn 

University were utilized from comparative online and traditional face-to-face classes in 

two separate courses. In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of 885 students 

enrolled in online and traditional face-to-face courses was identified. The sample 

included students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 

and 2006 in both the online and traditional face-to-face classes. Two instructors were 

responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-to-face classes for the 

period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential 

difference in the dependent variables, course grades due to delivery method (online and 

face-to-face), instructor (instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the 

two independent variables (Research Question 1). A chi-square test for differences 

among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention (Research 

Questions 2 and 3).

online and face-to-face courses were utilized. 

2. 

The study was confined to students enrolled at Washburn University in the 

Technology Administration program. 

3. 

Only grades and retention were analyzed. 

Assumptions 

Assumptions are defined as those things presupposed in a study (Roberts, 2004). 

The study was based on the following assumptions: 

1. 

Delivery of content was consistent between online and face-to-face 

courses and instructors, 

2. 

Course objectives were the same for paired online and traditional face-to-

face courses,  

3. 

All students enrolled in the TA program met the same criteria for 

4. 

5. 

admission to the University,  

All data entered in the Excel spreadsheets were correct, 

All students enrolled in the TA program met the same criteria for grade 

point average and program prerequisites. 


 
 
 
 
Definitions 

10 

The following terms are defined for the purpose of this study: 

Distance education. Education or training courses delivered to remote locations 

via postal delivery, or broadcast by audio, video, or computer technologies (Allen, 2007).  

Dropout. A dropout is defined as a student who has left school and discontinued 

studies (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 1998).  

Face-to-face delivery. This is a course that uses no online technology; content is 

delivered in person, either in written or oral form (Allen, 2007). 

Hybrid course. This course is a blend of the online and face-to-face course. A 

substantial proportion of the content is delivered online, typically using some online 

discussions and some face-to-face meetings (Allen, 2007). 

Online course. This defines a course where most or all of the content is delivered 

online via computer technologies. Typically, there are no face-to-face meetings (Allen, 

2007). 

2+2 PLAN. The Partnership for Learning and Networking is a collaborative set of 

online 2+2 baccalaureate degree programs developed by Washburn University. The 

programs require completion of an associate degree from one of the partner community 

or technical colleges (Washburn University, 2008).  

Retention. This term refers to the completion of a course by receiving a letter 

grade in a course, or a certificate of completion or degree for program completion

CHAPTER ONE 

INTRODUCTION 

Historically, postsecondary education in the United States was founded on the 

principles of the European system, requiring the physical presence of professors and 

students in the same location (Knowles, 1994). From 1626, with the founding of Harvard 

University (The Harvard Guide, 2004), to the development of junior colleges and 

vocational schools in the early 1900s (Cohen & Brawer, 1996; Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), 

the higher education system developed to prepare post-high school students for one of 

three separate tiers. The college and university system in the United States developed its 

own set of structures designed to prepare students for baccalaureate and graduate degrees. 

Junior colleges were limited to associate degrees, while vocational education institutions 

offered occupational certificates. In many cases, there was inadequate recognition of the 

postsecondary education offered at junior colleges and vocational education institutions, 

resulting in the inability of students to transfer to 4-year institutions (National Center for 

Education Statistics, 2006).  

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges began to provide academic, 

vocational, and personal development educational offerings for members of the local 

communities. During this same period, junior or community colleges developed a role as 

transfer institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or 

distance, could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & 

Brawer, 1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs involved Associate 

of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Associate of Applied Science 

(AAS) degrees were developed during the 1990s. The AAS degree was granted to those 


2 

who successfully completed the majority of their college program in vocational 

education. The creation of a variety of applied baccalaureate degrees allowed students 

who had previously thought of the AAS degree as a terminal program to complete a 

baccalaureate degree (Kansas Board of Regents, 2002-2003).  

Online education also became a strategy for students to access higher education in 

the 1990s (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). The proliferation of online courses alleviated some 

of the location-bound barriers to higher education, but online education was criticized as 

less rigorous than traditional classroom-based course work by traditional academicians. 

Russell attempted to address this argument with his 1999 meta-analysis of studies dating 

from the 1920s and covering multiple delivery models, including online education. 

Russell concluded there was no statistically significant difference in student achievement 

between courses offered online and those offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

Since the development of correspondence courses in the 1920s, researchers have 

attempted to ascertain if students participating in distance education are being 

shortchanged in their educational goals. No significant difference in grades has been 

found in the majority of studies designed to address this issue. Studies analyzing online 

student retention have shown significantly lower retention for online students.  In the last 

10 years, research studies have expanded to include variations of online education. These 

include strictly online, hybrid courses, Web-assisted classroom settings, and the 

traditional higher education course offered only as face-to-face instruction (Carmel & 

Gold, 2007).  

Online education continues to proliferate at the same time the number of 

secondary students in the United States overall is projected to increase (National Center 


3 

for Education Statistics [NCES], 2006). The projected increase of potential postsecondary 

students and online postsecondary options provides opportunities for increases in online 

education programs and courses. In 2000, NCES reported that over 65% of students in 

higher education were participating in online courses. In a 2007 study, Allen and Seaman 

estimated only 16% of those enrolled in online education courses are undergraduate 

students seeking their first degree, counter to the projected increase in traditional-age 

students. The majority of enrollees in online education are adults updating or advancing 

their credentials, creating an additional educational market for colleges and universities 

seeking to expand enrollment without adding physical space (Allen & Seaman, 2007a). 

For states and localities faced with a contradictory traditional-age enrollment decrease, 

these figures present an untapped market for higher education courses and programs. 

Background 

Researchers attempted to analyze the efficacy of distance education as far back as 

the 1920s when correspondence courses were created to meet the need of students not 

willing to attend a traditional classroom-based higher education setting. A meta-analysis 

of these studies resulted in The No Significant Difference Phenomenon, reported by 

Russell (2001). The results of over 355 studies were compiled, comparing various modes 

of delivery including correspondence, audio, television courses, and the newest wave of 

computer-facilitated instruction. Following analyses of studies completed prior to 2001, 

Russell concluded there was no difference in learning between students enrolled in 

distance education and those completing courses in the traditional setting.  

Studies completed since then have provided mixed results. Summers, Waigand, 

and Whittaker (2005) found there was no difference in GPA and retention between the 


4 

online and traditional classroom. Arle (2002) found higher achievement by online 

students, and Brown and Liedholm (2002) found GPA and student retention better in a 

traditional classroom setting.  

Student retention is an integral part of the student achievement conversation and 

is an issue for all forms of higher education. Degree-seeking students overall retention 

has been reported as less than 56% by NCES (2001). Long considered a problem in 

higher education, attention to the distance education model has shown even lower 

retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college 

setting (Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). Research on different modalities, such as fully 

online and hybrid online courses, has produced mixed results (Carmel & Gold, 2007). No 

significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities 

has been documented.  

Retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined 

students transfering from a community college. Statistics have consistantly shown a 

lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a 4-year 

university than for students who began their post-high school education at a 4-year 

institution (NCES, 2006). Townsends studies of transfer students at the University of 

Missouri-Columbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who 

had completed an AAS degree than for students beginning their education at a 4-year 

institution (Townsend, 2002). 

Occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively 

new to higher education. Transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges 

to 4-year institutions were common by the 1990s. Townsend (2001), in her study 


 
5 

conducted at the University of MissouriColumbia, observed the blurring of the lines 

between non-transferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and 

undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred. The study conducted 

by Townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their 

education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that 

grew after their completion of an occupationally-oriented degree. Laanan proposed that 

the increase in institutions offering AAS degrees necessitated new ways to transfer 

undergraduate credits (2003).  

The setting of this study is a medium-sized Midwestern campus located in 

Topeka, Kansas. Washburn University enrolls approximately 6000 students a year in 

undergraduate and graduate programs, including liberal arts, professional schools, and a 

law school (Washburn University, 2008). The Technology Administration (TA) program 

selected for the present study began in the 1990s as a baccalaureate degree completion 

program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a 

Kansas community college or through Washburns articulation agreement with Kansas 

vocational-technical schools. This program provided students who previously had 

obtained an Associate of Applied Science degree in an occupational area an opportunity 

to earn a bachelors degree. 

Peterson, Dean of Continuing Education, Washburn University, stated that in 

early 1999, Washburn University began online courses and programs at the behest of a 

neighboring community college (personal communication, April 18, 2008). Washburn 

was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students 

graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an Associate of Applied 


6 

Science degree. The TA program was among the first programs to offer the online 

bachelors degree completion option. The TA program offered its first online courses in 

Spring 2000.  

Online education at Washburn expanded to other programs and courses, to 

include over 200 courses (Washburn University, 2008). The original online partnership 

with two community colleges expanded to include 16 additional community colleges and 

four technical colleges in Kansas, as well as colleges in Missouri, California, Wisconsin, 

South Carolina, and Nebraska (Washburn University, 2008). 

An initial study in 2002 of students course grades and retention in online courses 

offered at Washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face course work (Peterson,  personal 

communication, April 18, 2008). No studies of program retention have been completed.  

In 2008, Atkins reported overall enrollment at Washburn University decreased 

6.7% from Fall 2004 to Fall 2008, from 7400 to 6901 students. During the same period, 

online course enrollment patterns increased 65%, from 3550 students to 5874 in 2007-

2008 (Washburn University, 2008). Atkins also reported that between 1998 and 2008, the 

ratio of traditional post-high school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at 

Washburn University reversed from 40:60 to 60:40. The shift in enrollment patterns 

produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the 21st century; however, 

Washburn University anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in Kansas through 

2016, based on demographic patterns of the state. The state figures are opposite the 

anticipated increase of traditional-age students nationally (NCES, 2008). The increase in 


distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditional-age 

students provided the focus for the study.

Purpose of the Study 

Online education has become an important strategy for the higher education 

institution that was the setting of this study. First, the purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students 

participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The 

second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference 

between course retention of students participating in TA online courses and their 

traditional classroom-based counterparts. The second part of the study was a replication 

of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroom-based 

instruction (Carmel & Gold, 2007; Russell, 1999). A third purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who 

began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in 

traditional face-to-face courses. The studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base 

concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree 

completion opportunities. 

Research Questions 

Roberts (2004) stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the 

structure for presenting the results of the research. The research questions guiding this 

study were: 


 
8 

1. 

Is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in 

online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

2. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates 

in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

3. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for 

students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students 

entering the program enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes? 

Overview of the Methodology 

A quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course, course retention, 

and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-face TA 

program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at Washburn 

University were utilized from comparative online and traditional face-to-face classes in 

two separate courses. In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of 885 students 

enrolled in online and traditional face-to-face courses was identified. The sample 

included students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 

and 2006 in both the online and traditional face-to-face classes. Two instructors were 

responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-to-face classes for the 

period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential 

difference in the dependent variables, course grades due to delivery method (online and 

face-to-face), instructor (instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the 

two independent variables (Research Question 1). A chi-square test for differences 

among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention (Research 

Questions 2 and 3).  


 
9 

Delimitations 

Roberts (2004) defined delimitations as the boundaries of the study that are 

controlled principally by the researcher. The delimitations for this study were 

1. 

Only data from 2002 through 2008 from Technology Administration 

online and face-to-face courses were utilized. 

2. 

The study was confined to students enrolled at Washburn University in the 

Technology Administration program. 

3. 

Only grades and retention were analyzed. 

Assumptions 

Assumptions are defined as those things presupposed in a study (Roberts, 2004). 

The study was based on the following assumptions: 

1. 

Delivery of content was consistent between online and face-to-face 

courses and instructors, 

2. 

Course objectives were the same for paired online and traditional face-to-

face courses,  

3. 

All students enrolled in the TA program met the same criteria for 

4. 

5. 

admission to the University,  

All data entered in the Excel spreadsheets were correct, 

All students enrolled in the TA program met the same criteria for grade 

point average and program prerequisites. 


 
 
 
 
Definitions 

10 

The following terms are defined for the purpose of this study: 

Distance education. Education or training courses delivered to remote locations 

via postal delivery, or broadcast by audio, video, or computer technologies (Allen, 2007).  

Dropout. A dropout is defined as a student who has left school and discontinued 

studies (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 1998).  

Face-to-face delivery. This is a course that uses no online technology; content is 

delivered in person, either in written or oral form (Allen, 2007). 

Hybrid course. This course is a blend of the online and face-to-face course. A 

substantial proportion of the content is delivered online, typically using some online 

discussions and some face-to-face meetings (Allen, 2007). 

Online course. This defines a course where most or all of the content is delivered 

online via computer technologies. Typically, there are no face-to-face meetings (Allen, 

2007). 

2+2 PLAN. The Partnership for Learning and Networking is a collaborative set of 

online 2+2 baccalaureate degree programs developed by Washburn University. The 

programs require completion of an associate degree from one of the partner community 

or technical colleges (Washburn University, 2008).  

Retention. This term refers to the completion of a course by receiving a letter 

grade in a course, or a certificate of completion or degree for program completion 

(Washburn University, 2008).

CHAPTER TWO 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

This chapter presents the background for research into the efficacy of distance 

education in the delivery of higher education. Research studies have focused primarily on 

grades as a measure of the quality of distance education courses as compared to 

traditional face-to-face instruction. Utilizing grades has produced a dividing line among 

education researchers concerning the use of distance education as a delivery model. 

Retention in distance education has focused primarily on single courses, with little 

program retention data available. Data from retention studies in higher education have 

focused primarily on the traditional 4-year university student. Retention studies of 

community college students have produced quantitative results; however, these studies 

have been directed at community college students who identify themselves as transfer 

students early in their community college careers. Retention studies of students enrolled 

in occupationally oriented programs are limited. 

Statistical data of higher education shows an increased use of distance education 

for traditional academic courses as well as occupationally oriented courses. The increase 

in distance education courses and programs has provided a new dimension to studies of 

both grades and retention. The recognition of this increase, as well as questions 

concerning its impact on student learning and retention, produced the impetus for this 

study. 

The following review of the literature represents the literature related to this 

research study. Through examination of previous research, the direction of the present 

study was formulated. Specifically, the chapter is organized into four sections: (a) the 


13 

history of occupational transfer programs; (b) the history and research of distance 

education, including occupational transfer programs utilizing distance education; (c) 

research utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning in online education; and (d) 

research focusing on student retention in higher education, including student retention 

issues in transfer education and online transfer courses and programs. 

History of Occupational Transfer Programs 

The measure of success in higher education has been characterized as the 

attainment of a bachelors degree at a 4-year university. Occupationally oriented 

education was considered primarily a function of job preparation, and until the 1990s was 

not considered transferrable to other higher education institutions. Occupational transfer 

programs are a recent occurrence within the postsecondary system that provides an 

additional pathway to bachelors degree completion.  

Historically, the postsecondary experience in the United States developed as a 

three-track system. Colleges were established in the United States in 1636 with the 

founding of Harvard College (The Harvard Guide, 2004). Junior colleges were first 

founded in 1901 as experimental post-high school graduate programs (Joliet Junior 

College History, 2008). Their role was initially as a transfer institution to the university. 

When the Smith-Hughes Act was passed in 1917, a system of vocational education was 

born in the United States (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), and was designed to provide further 

education to those students not viewed as capable of success in a university setting. 

Vocational education, currently referred to as occupational or technical education, 

was not originally designed to be a path to higher education. The first programs were 

designed to help agricultural workers complete their education and increase their skills. 


14 

More vocational programs were developed during the early 20th century as 

industrialization developed and as increasing numbers of skills were needed by workers 

in blue-collar occupations (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003). 

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges expanded their programs beyond 

academic selections to provide occupational development and continuing education. 

Because of the geographic area from which they attracted students, junior colleges 

developed a role as community colleges. They also solidified their role as transfer 

institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or distance, 

could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & Brawer, 

1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs to 4-year universities 

involved traditional academic degrees, including the Associate of Arts (AA) and 

Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Occupational programs and continuing education 

were viewed as terminal and non-transferrable. 

In 1984, Congress authorized the Carl Perkins Vocational and Technical 

Education Act (P.L. 98-524). In the legislation, Congress responded to employers 

concerns about the lack of basic skills in employees by adding academic requirements to 

vocational education legislation. Vocational program curriculum was expanded to include 

language arts, mathematics, and science principles, and the curriculum reflected the 

context of the program. The Secretarys Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills 

(SCANS) was created in 1990 to determine the skills young people need to succeed in the 

world of work (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). In the second Carl Perkins 

reauthorization in 1990 (P.L. 105-332), Congress responded to the report, which targeted 

academic and job skills, by outlining a seamless system of vocational and academic 


15 

education to prepare vocational students to progress into and through higher education. 

This emphasis led to the development of Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees 

during the 1990s. Granted to those who have successfully completed programs in the 

applied arts and sciences for careers, AAS degrees were seen as terminal (Kansas Board 

of Regents, 2002-2003). 

But as one goal was attained, conversation turned to creating a pathway from 

occupational associate degrees to bachelors degree completion. The desire of students to 

continue from technical degrees to a baccalaureate was not a new idea. In a paper 

presented in 1989 to the American Technical Association national conference, Troutt-

Ervin and Morgans overview of 2+2 programs showed acceptance of AAS degrees at 

traditional universities was generally non-existent. Their suggestion for an academic 

bridge from early technical education to baccalaureate programs highlighted programs 

accepting AAS degrees toward baccalaureate completion were an exception rather than a 

rule (Troutt-Ervin & Morgan, 1989). It was not until the late 1990s that applied 

baccalaureate degrees recognized credits from technical degree students who had 

previously thought of themselves in a terminal program to complete their baccalaureate 

degree (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the advance of recognition of AAS degrees, standard definitions of 

transfer students continued to exclude students who completed technical programs. The 

U.S. Department of Education did not include students receiving an Associate of Applied 

Science degree in the definition of students preparing for transfer to 4-year colleges 

(Bradburn, Hurst, & Peng, 2001; Carnevale, 2006). Most states had comparable policies 

in place concerning core academic curriculum, articulation agreements, transfer of credit, 


16 

and statewide transfer guides. There was no general recognition of occupational credit 

transfer. Only a few states, including Kansas, Missouri, and Washington, allowed credits 

earned in occupationally oriented degrees to transfer to 4-year institutions (Townsend, 

2001). No state had set clear goals for the transference of occupational credits between 

institutions or for the state as a whole (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the lack of recognition of occupational transfer credit at the federal level, 

a new definition of transfer education had emerged. Initially defined as the general 

education component of the first 2 years of a baccalaureate, the definition of transfer 

education now included any courses that transferred to a 4-year college, regardless of the 

nature of the courses (Townsend, 2001).  

The line between vocational schools, community colleges, and 4-year institutions 

blurred in the United States as employers and students increasingly made business 

decisions regarding education and workforce development. Employers increasingly asked 

for employees with academic and technical skills, as well as critical thinking skills and 

personal responsibility (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). Returning students themselves 

were more attuned to the demands of the 21st century workforce. Their desire to return to 

higher education, coupled with the economy and the variety of options available to them, 

required a more adaptive higher education system (Carnevale, 2006). There was growing 

demand among new and returning students for higher education opportunities responsive 

to their needs. The expanding needs of the returning student provided opportunities for 

higher education to respond by utilizing different delivery models. 


 
 
17 

Distance Education 

Online education became a strategy for postsecondary institutions when the first 

correspondence courses were initiated with the mail service in the early 20th century 

(Russell, 1999). As various technologies emerged, distance education utilized television 

and video models, in addition to paper-based correspondence courses. The expansion of 

distance education utilizing computer technologies renewed academic debate over the 

efficacy of the delivery model. 

Online education utilizing the Internet became a significant factor in the 1990s, 

prompting renewed evaluation of the use of distance learning opportunities (Russell, 

1999, Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). In 19992000, the number of students who took any 

distance education courses was 8.4% of total undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary 

education (NCES, 2000). In 2000, the report of the Web-Based Education Commission to 

the President and Congress concluded that the Internet was no longer in question as a tool 

to transform the way teaching and learning was offered. The Commission recommended 

that the nation embrace E-learning as a strategy to provide on-demand, high-quality 

teaching and professional development to keep the United States competitive in the 

global workforce. They also recommended continued funding of research into teaching 

and learning utilizing web-based resources (Web-Based Education Commission, 2000). 

The acceptance of the importance of the Internet for delivery of higher education opened 

new opportunities for research and continued the academic debate of the quality of 

instruction delivered in online education courses and programs. 

In a longitudinal study from 2002-2007, The Sloan Consortium, a group of higher 

education institutions actively involved in online education, began studies of online 


18 

education in the United States over a period of 5 years. In the first study, researchers 

Allen and Seaman (2003) conducted polls of postsecondary institutions involved with 

online education and found that students overwhelming responded to the availability of 

online education, with over 1.6 million students taking at least one online course during 

the Fall semester of 2002. Over one third of these students took all of their courses 

online. The survey also found that in 2002, 81% of all institutions of higher education 

offered at least one fully online or blended course (Allen & Seaman, 2003). 

In their intermediate report in 2005, Allen and Seaman postulated that online 

education had continued to make inroads in postsecondary education, with 65% of 

schools offering graduate courses and programs face-to-face also offering graduate 

courses online. Sixty-three percent of undergraduate institutions offering face-to-face 

courses also offered courses online. From 2003 to 2005, the survey results showed that 

online education, as a long-term strategy for institutions, had increased from 49% to 56%. 

In addition, core education online course offerings had increased (Allen & Seaman, 

2005). 

In Allen and Seamans final report (2007b) for the Sloan Consortium, the 

researchers reported that almost 3.5 million students participated in at least one online 

course during the Fall 2006 term, a nearly 10% increase over the number reported in the 

previous year. Allen and Seaman also reported a 9.7% increase in online enrollment, 

compared to the 1.5% growth in overall higher education. They found by 2007, 2-year 

institutions had the highest growth rates and accounted for over the half the online 

enrollments in the previous 5 years. The researchers concluded, based on a survey 


 
 
19 

conducted as part of the research, institutions believed that improved student access was 

the top reason for offering online courses and programs (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). 

Community colleges began embracing distance education in the 1920s as part of 

their mission to provide low-cost, time-effective education. Community colleges initially 

provided correspondence courses by mail, but later switched to television and video 

courses as technology improved (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). In 2001, over 90% of public 2-

year colleges in the United States provided distance education courses over the Internet 

(NCES, 2001).  

Vocational education, by the nature of its instructional format, was among the last 

of the educational institutions to participate in distance education. Because of the 

kinesthetic nature of instruction, vocational education leaders began investigating 

distance education opportunities in the 1990s, relying on the method to provide only the 

lecture portion of instruction. By 2004, only 31% of students enrolled in vocational 

schools had participated in some form of distance education during their program of 

study (NCES, 2005). In 2008, hands-on instruction in programs such as automobile 

mechanics and welding, and the clinical portion of health occupations programs, 

continued to be taught in the traditional classroom setting (NCES, 2008). 

Analysis of data reported by the NCES indicated that distance education had 

become a staple for higher education institutions. At both the 4-year and 2-year university 

level, over 65% of institutions offered more than 12 million courses in 2006-2007 by 

distance education. While vocational education had traditionally been more hands-on, 

distance education had become more prevalent in providing opportunities for students to 

participate in components of the system over the Internet (NCES, 2008).  


 
 
 
20 

Distance education became the prevalent strategy for higher education institutions 

to expand their services to new and returning students, without the financial implications 

of capital expansion. Higher education utilized the strategy to market to students outside 

their traditional geographic reach by utilizing the power of the Internet. The increasing 

demand from students of all ages for online opportunities provided new ground for the 

expansion of higher education opportunities. 

Grades as an Indicator of Quality of Student Learning 

The grading system in the United States educational system has served as an 

indicator of knowledge for over 100 years. Educators have utilized high school grades as 

a sorting mechanism in American schools to determine postsecondary opportunities. 

Modern society has accepted honors attainment, graduation honors, and course grades as 

an indicator of knowledge acquisition in postsecondary education. Stray (2001) reported 

that the use of grading in schools can be traced to the industrial revolution and the 

development of factories.  

William Farish of Cambridge University developed the first grading system in 

higher education in 1792 (Stray, 2001). Farish mimicked the system established by 

factories of the time: grade A being the best. The thought was that Farish employed the 

grading system in order to teach more students, an aberration at that time when 

instructors rarely had more than a few. The demand for more higher education 

opportunities prompted Farish to open his class to more students, and as such, led to his 

use of a sorting system. This was the first known record of grading utilized in classrooms 

to measure student achievement (Stray, 2001). 


 
21 

Smallwood (1935) reported the first grading in higher education at Yale 

University in 1792. Stiles, President of Yale University, directed the use of the scale in 

the late 18th century. However, Smallwood noted it was not until 1813 that any record of 

grades or marking appeared. 

Using a scale of 100, philosophy and mathematic professors instituted the first use 

of a marking instrument in the 1800s at Harvard. Smallwood noted early systems were 

experimental, utilizing different numerical scales, with no standardized system in place 

between higher education institutions. It was not until the late 1800s that faculty began 

using descriptors, such as A and B, to rank students according to a predetermined 

numerical scale (Smallwood, 1935).  

Experimentation with evaluation of achievement continued into the early 20th 

century, when educational psychologists, including Dewey and Thorndike, attempted to 

compare grading scales with intelligence testing. Thorndikes philosophy of standardized 

testing and grading survived the 20th century, and his quote, Whatever exists at all exists 

in some amount (Thorndike, 1916, as cited in Ebel & Frisbie, p. 26) has been utilized in 

educational measurement textbooks as a validation of the use of standards of 

measurement to measure achievement (Ebel & Frisbie, 1991). 

The use of grades expanded to community colleges, high schools, and elementary 

schools in the early 1900s (Pressey, 1920). The use of grades throughout the educational 

system is fairly standardized today with the 4.0 scale. It is this standardization that allows 

comparison of grades as achievement between educational levels and institutions (Ebel & 

Frisbie, 1991) and allows grades to be utilized as a measure for comparison of 

educational achievement. 


22 

Researchers analyzing the success of community college transfer students have 

traditionally studied the grades of the traditional transfer student with an AA or AS 

degree. Keeley and Houses 1993 study of sophomore and junior transfer students at 

Northern Illinois University analyzed transfer shock (p. 2) for students matriculating 

from community colleges. The researchers found students who transferred from a 

community college obtained a grade point average significantly lower in their first 

semester than did students who began their college career at a 4-year institution. 

However, the results of the longitudinal studies showed that transfer students who 

persisted to graduation showed an equivalent GPA at baccalaureate completion (Keeley 

& House, 1993).  

Students who transferred from occupationally oriented degree programs typically 

were not included in traditional studies of transfer students. While the research in general 

does not include AAS students in traditional transfer data, limited conclusions were 

available comparing AAS students to traditional 4-year college attendees. Townsends 

study at the University of Missouri-Columbia (2002) showed no difference in grades at 

baccalaureate graduation between students with an AA/AS degree and students with an 

AAS degree.  

The use of grades as an indicator of the level of student achievement has been 

relied upon by studies comparing traditional classroom instruction and distance 

instruction. Research analyzing the effectiveness of student learning in distance education 

began with the first correspondence courses offered utilizing the mail service (Russell, 

1999). The study of effectiveness of correspondence courses expanded to include new 

technologies, such as television and video courses, and increased with the proliferation of 


 
23 

online educational offerings. Researchers continued to challenge the effectiveness of 

learning methods not delivered in traditional higher education settings. 

In 1991, Russell reviewed over 355 studies, dating from the 1930s and continuing 

through the late 1980s, and found no significant difference in student learning using any 

form of distance education, as compared with students in classroom-based instruction 

(Russell, 1999). Russells conclusion formed the basis for a series of works collectively 

known as No Significant Difference. Russells conclusion from his studies follows: 

The fact is the findings of comparative studies are absolutely conclusive; one can 

bank on them. No matter how it is produced, how it is delivered, whether or not it 

is interactive, low tech or high tech, students learn equally well with each 

technology and learn as well as their on-campus, face-to-face counterparts even 

though students would rather be on campus with the instructor if that were a real 

choice. (p. xviii) 

Overwhelmingly, studies have supported Russells conclusions, including 

Neuhausers (2002) study of traditional face-to-face education and online education in a 

business communications class at a large urban university in North Carolina. Neuhauser 

concluded there was no significant difference in pre- and post-test scores of students 

enrolled in online and traditional communications classes. In addition, Neuhauser found 

no significant difference in final grades, homework grades, and grades on research 

papers, even though learners in the online course were significantly older than were 

learners in the traditional face-to-face section.  

The Summers et al. (2005) research included a comparison of student 

achievement and satisfaction in an online versus a traditional face-to-face statistics class. 


24 

The study, conducted at the University of Missouri-Columbia, included undergraduate 

nursing students who were tested on both their pre- and post-course knowledge of 

statistics. Their results indicated that utilizing grades as an indicator of knowledge 

showed no significant difference between the online and traditional classroom students. 

In their meta-analysis, Machtmes and Asher (2002) reviewed 30 studies and concluded 

there did not appear to be a difference in achievement, as measured by grades, between 

distance and traditional learners. 

As technology use continued to evolve in online education, various studies were 

conducted to determine whether different delivery methods created a difference in the 

grades of online students compared to their face-to-face counterparts. A study conducted 

by Carmel and Gold (2007) supported Russells original conclusion by analyzing specific 

types of online platforms and delivery models. Carmel and Golds study included hybrid 

and traditional classroom-based instruction. They analyzed results from 164 students in 

110 courses and found no significant difference in student achievement based on grades 

between students enrolled in either delivery method.  

Additional studies supporting Russells theory have crossed multiple content 

areas and delivery models. Brown and Liedholms (2002) study at Michigan State 

University included microeconomics students in virtual, hybrid, and traditional 

classroom-based instruction. The study included 389 students in the traditional setting, 

258 in the hybrid delivery section and 89 students enrolled in online education.  No 

significant difference in student learning as measured by end of course grades was found. 

Research also showed type of course discipline is not affected by the online 

delivery model. Schulman and Simms (1999) compared pretest and posttest scores of 


25 

students enrolled in an online course and a traditional course at Nova Southeastern 

University. The researchers compared 40 undergraduate students enrolled in online 

courses and 59 undergraduate students enrolled in the classroom setting of the same 

course. Results indicated that the students who select online courses scored higher than 

traditional students scored on the pretest results. However, posttest results showed no 

significant difference for the online students versus the in-class students. Schulman and 

Simms concluded that online students were learning equally as well as their classroom-

based counterparts. Reigles (2007) analysis across disciplines at the University of San 

Francisco and the University of California found no significant difference between online 

and face-to-face student grade attainment. 

Shachar and Neumann (2003) conducted a meta-analysis that estimated and 

compared the differences between the academic performance of students enrolled in 

distance education compared to those enrolled in traditional settings over the period from 

1990-2002. Eighty-six studies containing data from over 15,000 participating students 

were included in their analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that in two-thirds 

of the cases, students taking courses by distance education outperformed their student 

counterparts enrolled in traditionally instructed courses.  

Lynch, during the use of the Tegrity system, a brand-specific online platform at 

Louisiana State University, found that students grades were slightly better after utilizing 

the technology than when the traditional approach was used (Lynch, 2002). Initial results 

of a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study of 5000 students over 2 years indicated 

that the U-Pace online students performed 12% better than their traditional Psychology 

101 counterparts on the same cumulative test (Perez, 2009). Arles (2002) study found 


26 

students enrolled in online human anatomy courses at Rio Salado College scored an 

average of 6.3% higher on assessments than the national achievement average. Students 

were assessed using a national standardized test generated by the Human Anatomy and 

Physiology Society, whose norming sample is based entirely on traditional classroom 

delivery (Arle, 2002).  

In a study conducted by Stephenson, Brown, and Griffin (2008), comparing three 

different delivery styles (traditional, asynchronous electronic courseware, and 

synchronous e-lectures), results indicated no increased effectiveness of any delivery style 

when all question types were taken into account. However, when results were analyzed, 

students receiving traditional lectures showed the lowest levels on questions designed to 

assess comprehension.  

Research found supporters in higher education academic leaders. In a 2006 survey 

of Midwestern postsecondary institutions concerning their online offerings, 56 % of 

academic leaders in the 11 states rated the learning outcomes in online education as the 

same or superior to those in face-to-face instructional settings. The proportion of higher 

education institutions believing that online learning outcomes were superior to those for 

face-to-face outcomes was still relatively small, but had grown by 34% since 2003, from 

10.2 to 13.7 % (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). This belief added merit to the conclusions 

supported by Russell and others. 

Russells (1999) no significant difference conclusion had its detractors. The 

most commonly cited is Phipps and Merisotis (1999), who reviewed Russells original 

meta-analysis (1999) and reported a much different conclusion. They concluded that the 

overall quality of the original research was questionable, that much of the research did 


27 

not control for extraneous variables, and therefore it could not show cause and effect. 

They included in their findings evidence that the studies utilized by Russell (2000) in the 

meta-analysis did not use randomly selected subjects, did not take into effect the 

differences among students, and did not include tests of validity and reliability.  

The  Phipps and Merisotis (1999) analysis included the conclusion that research 

has focused too much on individual courses rather than on academic programs, and has 

not taken into account differences among students. They postulated that based on these 

conclusions, there is a significant difference in the learning results, as evidenced by 

grades, of students participating in distance education as compared to their classroom-

based peers. Their analysis of Russells original work questioned both the quality and 

effectiveness of research comparing distance and traditional education delivery.  

While there has been ongoing conjecture that online education students are not 

receiving an equivalent learning experience compared to their traditional classroom 

counterparts, studies utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning have produced 

little evidence of the disparity. The incidence of studies showing significant negative 

differences in grades of online learners is small. Higher education institutions have 

indicated their support for online education, and its continued growth has allowed studies 

such as the present research to contribute to ongoing dialogue. 

Student Retention in Postsecondary Education 

Persistence and retention in higher education is an issue that has intrigued 

researchers for over 50 years. Quantitative studies conducted in the mid-20th century 

produced data that caused researchers to look at low retention rates in higher education 


28 

and search for answers. This question has continued to consume researchers and higher 

education institutions. 

In 1987, Tinto attempted to summarize studies of individual student retention in 

higher education by proposing a theory to allow higher education administrators to 

predict success and support students (Tinto, 1987). Tintos model of student engagement 

has been in use for over 20 years as higher education administrators and faculty attempt 

to explain student retention issues at universities and colleges. Tintos model primarily 

focused on factors of student engagement: How students respond to instructors, the 

higher education community itself, and students own engagement in learning are the 

primary factors Tinto theorized as determining the students retention. In the concluding 

remarks to his 1987 treatise on retention, Tinto acknowledged that persistence in higher 

education is but one facet of human growth and development, and one that cannot 

necessarily be attributed to a single factor or strategy. 

Tintos (1987) original study of student retention included the observation that 

student retention is a complicated web of events that shape student leaving and 

persistence. He observed that the view of student retention had changed since the 1950s, 

when students were thought to leave due to lack of motivation, persistence, and skills, 

hence the name dropout. In the 1970s, research began to focus on the role of the 

environment in student decisions to stay or leave. In the 1990s, Tinto proposed that the 

actions of the faculty were the key to institutional efforts to enhance student retention 

(Tinto, 2007). This was a significant addition to his theory, placing the cause on the 

instructor instead of the student, and it has done much to influence retention strategies 


29 

utilized in higher education institutions (Tinto, 2007). Tintos studies have driven 

research in both traditional retention studies and those involving distance education.  

Studies of the persistence of the postsecondary student routinely focus on 4-year 

postsecondary education. It is only within the last 20 years that persistence studies have 

included community college students and occupational students, acknowledging that their 

reasons for entering the postsecondary community are different from the traditional 4-

year higher education participant (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). With different avenues to a 

baccalaureate degree more prevalent, the research into college persistence has expanded 

to include other types of programs and students. 

Postsecondary student retention rates routinely utilize data from longitudinal 

studies of students entering in a Fall semester and completing a bachelors program no 

more than 6 years later (NCES, 2003). The National Center for Education Statistics 

reported that 55% of those seeking a baccalaureate degree would complete in 6 years 

(NCES, 2003). The report acknowledged institutions are unable to follow students who 

transfer to other institutions; they are able to report only the absence of enrollment in 

their own institution.  

Research has also found a large gap between community college entrants and 4-

year college entrants in rates of attaining a bachelors degree. Dougherty (1992) reported 

that students entering community college receive 11 to 19% fewer bachelors degrees 

than students beginning at a 4-year university. Dougherty postulated that the lower 

baccalaureate attainment rate of community college entrants was attributable to both their 

individual traits and the institution they entered (Dougherty, 1992). 


30 

Studies of student retention of community college also vary based on the types of 

students. Community college retention rates are routinely reported as lower than 

traditional 4-year institutions (NCES, 2007). Cohen and Brawer (1996) attributed the 

differences in retention to the difference in the mission. In many instances, students did 

not enroll in a community college in order to attain a degree (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). 

The most recent longitudinal study in 1993 showed a retention rate of 55.4% of students 

after 3 years (NCES, 2001).  

Of community college students, only 60.9% indicated a desire to transfer later to a 

baccalaureate degree completion program (NCES, 2003). While retention data collected 

by the federal government (NCES, 2003) did not include students with an AAS degree, 

Townsends studies of the transfer rates and baccalaureate attainment rates of students in 

Missouri who had completed an Associate of Arts and students who had completed an 

Associate of Applied Science degree was 61% compared to 54% (Townsend, 2001).  

Vocational or occupational programs have reported retention rates as program 

completion, a definition involving completion of specific tasks and competencies 

instead of grades and tied to a limited program length. This state and federal requirement 

indicates program quality and ensures continued federal funding. In 2001, the U.S. 

Department of Education reported a 60.1% completion rate of postsecondary students 

enrolled in occupational education (NCES, 2007). Until 1995, the reasons for students 

leaving was neither delineated nor reported; it was not until federal reporting 

requirements under the Carl Perkins Act of 1994 that institutions were required to explore 

why students were not retained in vocational programs (P.L. 105-332). 


31 

Distance education provided a new arena for the study of student persistence. 

Theorists and researchers have attempted to utilize Tintos model of student persistence 

to explain retention issues involved with distance education. However, Rovai (2003) 

analyzed the differing student characteristics of distance learners as compared to the 

traditional students targeted by Tintos original models and concluded that student 

retention theories proposed from that population were no longer applicable to distance 

education learners. Rovai proposed that distance educators could address retention in 

ways that traditional higher education has not. He suggested that distance educators 

utilize strategies such as capitalizing on students expectations of technology, addressing 

economic benefits and specific educational needs to increase student retention in courses 

(Rovai, 2003). 

The expanded use of technology created a distinct subset of research into student 

retention issues. In 2004, Berge and Huang developed an overview of models of student 

retention, with special emphasis on models developed to explain the retention rates in 

distance education. Their studies primarily focused on the variables in student 

demographics and external factors, such as age and gender, which influence persistence 

and retention in online learning. Berge and Huang found that traditional models of 

student retention such as Tintos did not acknowledge the differences in student 

expectations and goals that are ingrained in the students selection of the online learning 

option. 

Other researchers have attempted to study retention issues specifically for online 

education. In a meta-analysis, Nora and Snyder (2009) found the majority of studies of 

online education focused on students individual characteristics and individual 


32 

perceptions of technology. Nora and Snyder concluded that researchers attempt to utilize 

traditional models of student engagement to explain student retention issues in distance or 

online learning courses, with little or no success. This supported Berge and Huards 

conclusions. Nora and Snyder (2009) also noted a dearth of quantitative research.  

Few quantitative studies exist that support higher or equal retention in online 

students compared to their classroom-based counterparts. One example is the Carmel and 

Gold (2007) study. They found no significant difference in student retention rates 

between students in distance education courses and their traditional classroom-based 

counterparts. The study utilized data from 164 students, 95 enrolled in classroom-based 

courses and 69 enrolled in a hybrid online format. Participants randomly self-selected and 

were not all enrolled in the same course, introducing variables not attributed in the study.  

The majority of quantitative studies instead concluded there is a higher retention 

rate in traditional classrooms than in distance education. In the Phipps and Merisotis 

(1999) review of Russells original research, which included online education, results 

indicated that research has shown even lower retention rates in online students than in 

students attending classes in the traditional college setting. The high dropout rate among 

distance education students was not addressed in Russells meta-analysis, and Phipps and 

Merisotis found no suitable explanation in the research. They postulated that the 

decreased retention rate documented within distance education studies skews 

achievement data by excluding the dropouts. 

Diaz (2002) found a high drop rate for online students compared to traditional 

classroom-based students in an online health education course at Nova Southeastern. 

Other studies have supported the theory that retention of online students is far below that 


33 

of the traditional campus students. In 2002, Carr, reporting for The Chronicle of Higher 

Education, noted that online courses routinely lose 50 % of students who originally 

enrolled, as compared to a retention rate of 70-75% of traditional face-to-face students. 

Carr reported dropout rates of up to 75% in online courses as a likely indicator of the 

difficultly faced in retaining distance education students who do not routinely meet with 

faculty. The data have not been refuted. 

As community colleges began utilizing distance education, retention rates were 

reported as higher than traditional students (Nash, 1984). However, the California 

Community College System report for Fall 2008 courses showed inconsistent retention 

results for distance education learners, varying by the type of course. Results indicated 

equivalent retention rates for online instruction compared to traditional coursework in the 

majority of courses. Lower retention rates were indicated in online engineering, social 

sciences, and mathematics courses as compared to traditional classroom instructional 

models (California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, 2009). 

Due to the limited number of vocational/technical or occupational courses taught 

in the online mode, there was little data on student retention. In 1997, Hogan studied 

technical course and program completion of students in distance and traditional 

vocational education and found that course completion rates were higher for distance 

education students. However, program completion rates were higher for traditional 

students than for students enrolled in distance education (Hogan, 1997).  

In summary, studies of retention have focused primarily on student characteristics 

while acknowledging that postsecondary retention rates vary according to a variety of 

factors. Research showed mixed results concerning the retention rate of online students, 


34 

though quantitative data leans heavily toward a lower course retention rate in online 

students. Data from 4-year universities have shown lower retention rates for online 

students than for traditional face-to-face students, while community colleges have shown 

inconsistent results. Data from vocational-technical education has been limited, but 

course retention rates are higher for online students, while program retention rates are 

lower. No significant research factor affecting retention has been isolated between 

students in online baccalaureate completion programs and students participating in 

traditional classroom-based settings. 

Summary 

Research studies have been conducted analyzing student retention in higher 

education, transfer and retention of students from community colleges to universities, the 

impact of distance education, and student achievement and retention factors related to 

distance education. However, no comparative research was identified that compared the 

achievement and retention of students participating in an occupationally oriented transfer 

program utilizing both online education and traditional classroom-based instruction.

CHAPTER ONE 

INTRODUCTION 

Historically, postsecondary education in the United States was founded on the 

principles of the European system, requiring the physical presence of professors and 

students in the same location (Knowles, 1994). From 1626, with the founding of Harvard 

University (The Harvard Guide, 2004), to the development of junior colleges and 

vocational schools in the early 1900s (Cohen & Brawer, 1996; Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), 

the higher education system developed to prepare post-high school students for one of 

three separate tiers. The college and university system in the United States developed its 

own set of structures designed to prepare students for baccalaureate and graduate degrees. 

Junior colleges were limited to associate degrees, while vocational education institutions 

offered occupational certificates. In many cases, there was inadequate recognition of the 

postsecondary education offered at junior colleges and vocational education institutions, 

resulting in the inability of students to transfer to 4-year institutions (National Center for 

Education Statistics, 2006).  

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges began to provide academic, 

vocational, and personal development educational offerings for members of the local 

communities. During this same period, junior or community colleges developed a role as 

transfer institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or 

distance, could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & 

Brawer, 1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs involved Associate 

of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Associate of Applied Science 

(AAS) degrees were developed during the 1990s. The AAS degree was granted to those 


2 

who successfully completed the majority of their college program in vocational 

education. The creation of a variety of applied baccalaureate degrees allowed students 

who had previously thought of the AAS degree as a terminal program to complete a 

baccalaureate degree (Kansas Board of Regents, 2002-2003).  

Online education also became a strategy for students to access higher education in 

the 1990s (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). The proliferation of online courses alleviated some 

of the location-bound barriers to higher education, but online education was criticized as 

less rigorous than traditional classroom-based course work by traditional academicians. 

Russell attempted to address this argument with his 1999 meta-analysis of studies dating 

from the 1920s and covering multiple delivery models, including online education. 

Russell concluded there was no statistically significant difference in student achievement 

between courses offered online and those offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

Since the development of correspondence courses in the 1920s, researchers have 

attempted to ascertain if students participating in distance education are being 

shortchanged in their educational goals. No significant difference in grades has been 

found in the majority of studies designed to address this issue. Studies analyzing online 

student retention have shown significantly lower retention for online students.  In the last 

10 years, research studies have expanded to include variations of online education. These 

include strictly online, hybrid courses, Web-assisted classroom settings, and the 

traditional higher education course offered only as face-to-face instruction (Carmel & 

Gold, 2007).  

Online education continues to proliferate at the same time the number of 

secondary students in the United States overall is projected to increase (National Center 


3 

for Education Statistics [NCES], 2006). The projected increase of potential postsecondary 

students and online postsecondary options provides opportunities for increases in online 

education programs and courses. In 2000, NCES reported that over 65% of students in 

higher education were participating in online courses. In a 2007 study, Allen and Seaman 

estimated only 16% of those enrolled in online education courses are undergraduate 

students seeking their first degree, counter to the projected increase in traditional-age 

students. The majority of enrollees in online education are adults updating or advancing 

their credentials, creating an additional educational market for colleges and universities 

seeking to expand enrollment without adding physical space (Allen & Seaman, 2007a). 

For states and localities faced with a contradictory traditional-age enrollment decrease, 

these figures present an untapped market for higher education courses and programs. 

Background 

Researchers attempted to analyze the efficacy of distance education as far back as 

the 1920s when correspondence courses were created to meet the need of students not 

willing to attend a traditional classroom-based higher education setting. A meta-analysis 

of these studies resulted in The No Significant Difference Phenomenon, reported by 

Russell (2001). The results of over 355 studies were compiled, comparing various modes 

of delivery including correspondence, audio, television courses, and the newest wave of 

computer-facilitated instruction. Following analyses of studies completed prior to 2001, 

Russell concluded there was no difference in learning between students enrolled in 

distance education and those completing courses in the traditional setting.  

Studies completed since then have provided mixed results. Summers, Waigand, 

and Whittaker (2005) found there was no difference in GPA and retention between the 


4 

online and traditional classroom. Arle (2002) found higher achievement by online 

students, and Brown and Liedholm (2002) found GPA and student retention better in a 

traditional classroom setting.  

Student retention is an integral part of the student achievement conversation and 

is an issue for all forms of higher education. Degree-seeking students overall retention 

has been reported as less than 56% by NCES (2001). Long considered a problem in 

higher education, attention to the distance education model has shown even lower 

retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college 

setting (Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). Research on different modalities, such as fully 

online and hybrid online courses, has produced mixed results (Carmel & Gold, 2007). No 

significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities 

has been documented.  

Retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined 

students transfering from a community college. Statistics have consistantly shown a 

lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a 4-year 

university than for students who began their post-high school education at a 4-year 

institution (NCES, 2006). Townsends studies of transfer students at the University of 

Missouri-Columbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who 

had completed an AAS degree than for students beginning their education at a 4-year 

institution (Townsend, 2002). 

Occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively 

new to higher education. Transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges 

to 4-year institutions were common by the 1990s. Townsend (2001), in her study 


 
5 

conducted at the University of MissouriColumbia, observed the blurring of the lines 

between non-transferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and 

undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred. The study conducted 

by Townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their 

education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that 

grew after their completion of an occupationally-oriented degree. Laanan proposed that 

the increase in institutions offering AAS degrees necessitated new ways to transfer 

undergraduate credits (2003).  

The setting of this study is a medium-sized Midwestern campus located in 

Topeka, Kansas. Washburn University enrolls approximately 6000 students a year in 

undergraduate and graduate programs, including liberal arts, professional schools, and a 

law school (Washburn University, 2008). The Technology Administration (TA) program 

selected for the present study began in the 1990s as a baccalaureate degree completion 

program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a 

Kansas community college or through Washburns articulation agreement with Kansas 

vocational-technical schools. This program provided students who previously had 

obtained an Associate of Applied Science degree in an occupational area an opportunity 

to earn a bachelors degree. 

Peterson, Dean of Continuing Education, Washburn University, stated that in 

early 1999, Washburn University began online courses and programs at the behest of a 

neighboring community college (personal communication, April 18, 2008). Washburn 

was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students 

graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an Associate of Applied 


6 

Science degree. The TA program was among the first programs to offer the online 

bachelors degree completion option. The TA program offered its first online courses in 

Spring 2000.  

Online education at Washburn expanded to other programs and courses, to 

include over 200 courses (Washburn University, 2008). The original online partnership 

with two community colleges expanded to include 16 additional community colleges and 

four technical colleges in Kansas, as well as colleges in Missouri, California, Wisconsin, 

South Carolina, and Nebraska (Washburn University, 2008). 

An initial study in 2002 of students course grades and retention in online courses 

offered at Washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face course work (Peterson,  personal 

communication, April 18, 2008). No studies of program retention have been completed.  

In 2008, Atkins reported overall enrollment at Washburn University decreased 

6.7% from Fall 2004 to Fall 2008, from 7400 to 6901 students. During the same period, 

online course enrollment patterns increased 65%, from 3550 students to 5874 in 2007-

2008 (Washburn University, 2008). Atkins also reported that between 1998 and 2008, the 

ratio of traditional post-high school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at 

Washburn University reversed from 40:60 to 60:40. The shift in enrollment patterns 

produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the 21st century; however, 

Washburn University anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in Kansas through 

2016, based on demographic patterns of the state. The state figures are opposite the 

anticipated increase of traditional-age students nationally (NCES, 2008). The increase in 


distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditional-age 

students provided the focus for the study.

Purpose of the Study 

Online education has become an important strategy for the higher education 

institution that was the setting of this study. First, the purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students 

participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The 

second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference 

between course retention of students participating in TA online courses and their 

traditional classroom-based counterparts. The second part of the study was a replication 

of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroom-based 

instruction (Carmel & Gold, 2007; Russell, 1999). A third purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who 

began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in 

traditional face-to-face courses. The studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base 

concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree 

completion opportunities. 

Research Questions 

Roberts (2004) stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the 

structure for presenting the results of the research. The research questions guiding this 

study were: 


 
8 

1. 

Is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in 

online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

2. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates 

in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

3. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for 

students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students 

entering the program enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes? 

Overview of the Methodology 

A quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course, course retention, 

and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-face TA 

program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at Washburn 

University were utilized from comparative online and traditional face-to-face classes in 

two separate courses. In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of 885 students 

enrolled in online and traditional face-to-face courses was identified. The sample 

included students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 

and 2006 in both the online and traditional face-to-face classes. Two instructors were 

responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-to-face classes for the 

period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential 

difference in the dependent variables, course grades due to delivery method (online and 

face-to-face), instructor (instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the 

two independent variables (Research Question 1). A chi-square test for differences 

among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention (Research 

Questions 2 and 3).  


 
9 

Delimitations 

Roberts (2004) defined delimitations as the boundaries of the study that are 

controlled principally by the researcher. The delimitations for this study were 

1. 

Only data from 2002 through 2008 from Technology Administration 

online and face-to-face courses were utilized. 

2. 

The study was confined to students enrolled at Washburn University in the 

Technology Administration program. 

3. 

Only grades and retention were analyzed. 

Assumptions 

Assumptions are defined as those things presupposed in a study (Roberts, 2004). 

The study was based on the following assumptions: 

1. 

Delivery of content was consistent between online and face-to-face 

courses and instructors, 

2. 

Course objectives were the same for paired online and traditional face-to-

face courses,  

3. 

All students enrolled in the TA program met the same criteria for 

4. 

5. 

admission to the University,  

All data entered in the Excel spreadsheets were correct, 

All students enrolled in the TA program met the same criteria for grade 

point average and program prerequisites. 


 
 
 
 
Definitions 

10 

The following terms are defined for the purpose of this study: 

Distance education. Education or training courses delivered to remote locations 

via postal delivery, or broadcast by audio, video, or computer technologies (Allen, 2007).  

Dropout. A dropout is defined as a student who has left school and discontinued 

studies (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 1998).  

Face-to-face delivery. This is a course that uses no online technology; content is 

delivered in person, either in written or oral form (Allen, 2007). 

Hybrid course. This course is a blend of the online and face-to-face course. A 

substantial proportion of the content is delivered online, typically using some online 

discussions and some face-to-face meetings (Allen, 2007). 

Online course. This defines a course where most or all of the content is delivered 

online via computer technologies. Typically, there are no face-to-face meetings (Allen, 

2007). 

2+2 PLAN. The Partnership for Learning and Networking is a collaborative set of 

online 2+2 baccalaureate degree programs developed by Washburn University. The 

programs require completion of an associate degree from one of the partner community 

or technical colleges (Washburn University, 2008).  

Retention. This term refers to the completion of a course by receiving a letter 

grade in a course, or a certificate of completion or degree for program completion 

(Washburn University, 2008).  

Web-assisted. A course that uses Web-based technology to facilitate what is 

essentially a face-to-face course (Allen, 2007).

12 

CHAPTER TWO 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

This chapter presents the background for research into the efficacy of distance 

education in the delivery of higher education. Research studies have focused primarily on 

grades as a measure of the quality of distance education courses as compared to 

traditional face-to-face instruction. Utilizing grades has produced a dividing line among 

education researchers concerning the use of distance education as a delivery model. 

Retention in distance education has focused primarily on single courses, with little 

program retention data available. Data from retention studies in higher education have 

focused primarily on the traditional 4-year university student. Retention studies of 

community college students have produced quantitative results; however, these studies 

have been directed at community college students who identify themselves as transfer 

students early in their community college careers. Retention studies of students enrolled 

in occupationally oriented programs are limited. 

Statistical data of higher education shows an increased use of distance education 

for traditional academic courses as well as occupationally oriented courses. The increase 

in distance education courses and programs has provided a new dimension to studies of 

both grades and retention. The recognition of this increase, as well as questions 

concerning its impact on student learning and retention, produced the impetus for this 

study. 

The following review of the literature represents the literature related to this 

research study. Through examination of previous research, the direction of the present 

study was formulated. Specifically, the chapter is organized into four sections: (a) the 


13 

history of occupational transfer programs; (b) the history and research of distance 

education, including occupational transfer programs utilizing distance education; (c) 

research utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning in online education; and (d) 

research focusing on student retention in higher education, including student retention 

issues in transfer education and online transfer courses and programs. 

History of Occupational Transfer Programs 

The measure of success in higher education has been characterized as the 

attainment of a bachelors degree at a 4-year university. Occupationally oriented 

education was considered primarily a function of job preparation, and until the 1990s was 

not considered transferrable to other higher education institutions. Occupational transfer 

programs are a recent occurrence within the postsecondary system that provides an 

additional pathway to bachelors degree completion.  

Historically, the postsecondary experience in the United States developed as a 

three-track system. Colleges were established in the United States in 1636 with the 

founding of Harvard College (The Harvard Guide, 2004). Junior colleges were first 

founded in 1901 as experimental post-high school graduate programs (Joliet Junior 

College History, 2008). Their role was initially as a transfer institution to the university. 

When the Smith-Hughes Act was passed in 1917, a system of vocational education was 

born in the United States (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), and was designed to provide further 

education to those students not viewed as capable of success in a university setting. 

Vocational education, currently referred to as occupational or technical education, 

was not originally designed to be a path to higher education. The first programs were 

designed to help agricultural workers complete their education and increase their skills. 


14 

More vocational programs were developed during the early 20th century as 

industrialization developed and as increasing numbers of skills were needed by workers 

in blue-collar occupations (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003). 

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges expanded their programs beyond 

academic selections to provide occupational development and continuing education. 

Because of the geographic area from which they attracted students, junior colleges 

developed a role as community colleges. They also solidified their role as transfer 

institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or distance, 

could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & Brawer, 

1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs to 4-year universities 

involved traditional academic degrees, including the Associate of Arts (AA) and 

Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Occupational programs and continuing education 

were viewed as terminal and non-transferrable. 

In 1984, Congress authorized the Carl Perkins Vocational and Technical 

Education Act (P.L. 98-524). In the legislation, Congress responded to employers 

concerns about the lack of basic skills in employees by adding academic requirements to 

vocational education legislation. Vocational program curriculum was expanded to include 

language arts, mathematics, and science principles, and the curriculum reflected the 

context of the program. The Secretarys Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills 

(SCANS) was created in 1990 to determine the skills young people need to succeed in the 

world of work (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). In the second Carl Perkins 

reauthorization in 1990 (P.L. 105-332), Congress responded to the report, which targeted 

academic and job skills, by outlining a seamless system of vocational and academic 


15 

education to prepare vocational students to progress into and through higher education. 

This emphasis led to the development of Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees 

during the 1990s. Granted to those who have successfully completed programs in the 

applied arts and sciences for careers, AAS degrees were seen as terminal (Kansas Board 

of Regents, 2002-2003). 

But as one goal was attained, conversation turned to creating a pathway from 

occupational associate degrees to bachelors degree completion. The desire of students to 

continue from technical degrees to a baccalaureate was not a new idea. In a paper 

presented in 1989 to the American Technical Association national conference, Troutt-

Ervin and Morgans overview of 2+2 programs showed acceptance of AAS degrees at 

traditional universities was generally non-existent. Their suggestion for an academic 

bridge from early technical education to baccalaureate programs highlighted programs 

accepting AAS degrees toward baccalaureate completion were an exception rather than a 

rule (Troutt-Ervin & Morgan, 1989). It was not until the late 1990s that applied 

baccalaureate degrees recognized credits from technical degree students who had 

previously thought of themselves in a terminal program to complete their baccalaureate 

degree (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the advance of recognition of AAS degrees, standard definitions of 

transfer students continued to exclude students who completed technical programs. The 

U.S. Department of Education did not include students receiving an Associate of Applied 

Science degree in the definition of students preparing for transfer to 4-year colleges 

(Bradburn, Hurst, & Peng, 2001; Carnevale, 2006). Most states had comparable policies 

in place concerning core academic curriculum, articulation agreements, transfer of credit, 


16 

and statewide transfer guides. There was no general recognition of occupational credit 

transfer. Only a few states, including Kansas, Missouri, and Washington, allowed credits 

earned in occupationally oriented degrees to transfer to 4-year institutions (Townsend, 

2001). No state had set clear goals for the transference of occupational credits between 

institutions or for the state as a whole (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the lack of recognition of occupational transfer credit at the federal level, 

a new definition of transfer education had emerged. Initially defined as the general 

education component of the first 2 years of a baccalaureate, the definition of transfer 

education now included any courses that transferred to a 4-year college, regardless of the 

nature of the courses (Townsend, 2001).  

The line between vocational schools, community colleges, and 4-year institutions 

blurred in the United States as employers and students increasingly made business 

decisions regarding education and workforce development. Employers increasingly asked 

for employees with academic and technical skills, as well as critical thinking skills and 

personal responsibility (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). Returning students themselves 

were more attuned to the demands of the 21st century workforce. Their desire to return to 

higher education, coupled with the economy and the variety of options available to them, 

required a more adaptive higher education system (Carnevale, 2006). There was growing 

demand among new and returning students for higher education opportunities responsive 

to their needs. The expanding needs of the returning student provided opportunities for 

higher education to respond by utilizing different delivery models. 


 
 
17 

Distance Education 

Online education became a strategy for postsecondary institutions when the first 

correspondence courses were initiated with the mail service in the early 20th century 

(Russell, 1999). As various technologies emerged, distance education utilized television 

and video models, in addition to paper-based correspondence courses. The expansion of 

distance education utilizing computer technologies renewed academic debate over the 

efficacy of the delivery model. 

Online education utilizing the Internet became a significant factor in the 1990s, 

prompting renewed evaluation of the use of distance learning opportunities (Russell, 

1999, Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). In 19992000, the number of students who took any 

distance education courses was 8.4% of total undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary 

education (NCES, 2000). In 2000, the report of the Web-Based Education Commission to 

the President and Congress concluded that the Internet was no longer in question as a tool 

to transform the way teaching and learning was offered. The Commission recommended 

that the nation embrace E-learning as a strategy to provide on-demand, high-quality 

teaching and professional development to keep the United States competitive in the 

global workforce. They also recommended continued funding of research into teaching 

and learning utilizing web-based resources (Web-Based Education Commission, 2000). 

The acceptance of the importance of the Internet for delivery of higher education opened 

new opportunities for research and continued the academic debate of the quality of 

instruction delivered in online education courses and programs. 

In a longitudinal study from 2002-2007, The Sloan Consortium, a group of higher 

education institutions actively involved in online education, began studies of online 


18 

education in the United States over a period of 5 years. In the first study, researchers 

Allen and Seaman (2003) conducted polls of postsecondary institutions involved with 

online education and found that students overwhelming responded to the availability of 

online education, with over 1.6 million students taking at least one online course during 

the Fall semester of 2002. Over one third of these students took all of their courses 

online. The survey also found that in 2002, 81% of all institutions of higher education 

offered at least one fully online or blended course (Allen & Seaman, 2003). 

In their intermediate report in 2005, Allen and Seaman postulated that online 

education had continued to make inroads in postsecondary education, with 65% of 

schools offering graduate courses and programs face-to-face also offering graduate 

courses online. Sixty-three percent of undergraduate institutions offering face-to-face 

courses also offered courses online. From 2003 to 2005, the survey results showed that 

online education, as a long-term strategy for institutions, had increased from 49% to 56%. 

In addition, core education online course offerings had increased (Allen & Seaman, 

2005). 

In Allen and Seamans final report (2007b) for the Sloan Consortium, the 

researchers reported that almost 3.5 million students participated in at least one online 

course during the Fall 2006 term, a nearly 10% increase over the number reported in the 

previous year. Allen and Seaman also reported a 9.7% increase in online enrollment, 

compared to the 1.5% growth in overall higher education. They found by 2007, 2-year 

institutions had the highest growth rates and accounted for over the half the online 

enrollments in the previous 5 years. The researchers concluded, based on a survey 


 
 
19 

conducted as part of the research, institutions believed that improved student access was 

the top reason for offering online courses and programs (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). 

Community colleges began embracing distance education in the 1920s as part of 

their mission to provide low-cost, time-effective education. Community colleges initially 

provided correspondence courses by mail, but later switched to television and video 

courses as technology improved (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). In 2001, over 90% of public 2-

year colleges in the United States provided distance education courses over the Internet 

(NCES, 2001).  

Vocational education, by the nature of its instructional format, was among the last 

of the educational institutions to participate in distance education. Because of the 

kinesthetic nature of instruction, vocational education leaders began investigating 

distance education opportunities in the 1990s, relying on the method to provide only the 

lecture portion of instruction. By 2004, only 31% of students enrolled in vocational 

schools had participated in some form of distance education during their program of 

study (NCES, 2005). In 2008, hands-on instruction in programs such as automobile 

mechanics and welding, and the clinical portion of health occupations programs, 

continued to be taught in the traditional classroom setting (NCES, 2008). 

Analysis of data reported by the NCES indicated that distance education had 

become a staple for higher education institutions. At both the 4-year and 2-year university 

level, over 65% of institutions offered more than 12 million courses in 2006-2007 by 

distance education. While vocational education had traditionally been more hands-on, 

distance education had become more prevalent in providing opportunities for students to 

participate in components of the system over the Internet (NCES, 2008).  


 
 
 
20 

Distance education became the prevalent strategy for higher education institutions 

to expand their services to new and returning students, without the financial implications 

of capital expansion. Higher education utilized the strategy to market to students outside 

their traditional geographic reach by utilizing the power of the Internet. The increasing 

demand from students of all ages for online opportunities provided new ground for the 

expansion of higher education opportunities. 

Grades as an Indicator of Quality of Student Learning 

The grading system in the United States educational system has served as an 

indicator of knowledge for over 100 years. Educators have utilized high school grades as 

a sorting mechanism in American schools to determine postsecondary opportunities. 

Modern society has accepted honors attainment, graduation honors, and course grades as 

an indicator of knowledge acquisition in postsecondary education. Stray (2001) reported 

that the use of grading in schools can be traced to the industrial revolution and the 

development of factories.  

William Farish of Cambridge University developed the first grading system in 

higher education in 1792 (Stray, 2001). Farish mimicked the system established by 

factories of the time: grade A being the best. The thought was that Farish employed the 

grading system in order to teach more students, an aberration at that time when 

instructors rarely had more than a few. The demand for more higher education 

opportunities prompted Farish to open his class to more students, and as such, led to his 

use of a sorting system. This was the first known record of grading utilized in classrooms 

to measure student achievement (Stray, 2001). 


 
21 

Smallwood (1935) reported the first grading in higher education at Yale 

University in 1792. Stiles, President of Yale University, directed the use of the scale in 

the late 18th century. However, Smallwood noted it was not until 1813 that any record of 

grades or marking appeared. 

Using a scale of 100, philosophy and mathematic professors instituted the first use 

of a marking instrument in the 1800s at Harvard. Smallwood noted early systems were 

experimental, utilizing different numerical scales, with no standardized system in place 

between higher education institutions. It was not until the late 1800s that faculty began 

using descriptors, such as A and B, to rank students according to a predetermined 

numerical scale (Smallwood, 1935).  

Experimentation with evaluation of achievement continued into the early 20th 

century, when educational psychologists, including Dewey and Thorndike, attempted to 

compare grading scales with intelligence testing. Thorndikes philosophy of standardized 

testing and grading survived the 20th century, and his quote, Whatever exists at all exists 

in some amount (Thorndike, 1916, as cited in Ebel & Frisbie, p. 26) has been utilized in 

educational measurement textbooks as a validation of the use of standards of 

measurement to measure achievement (Ebel & Frisbie, 1991). 

The use of grades expanded to community colleges, high schools, and elementary 

schools in the early 1900s (Pressey, 1920). The use of grades throughout the educational 

system is fairly standardized today with the 4.0 scale. It is this standardization that allows 

comparison of grades as achievement between educational levels and institutions (Ebel & 

Frisbie, 1991) and allows grades to be utilized as a measure for comparison of 

educational achievement. 


22 

Researchers analyzing the success of community college transfer students have 

traditionally studied the grades of the traditional transfer student with an AA or AS 

degree. Keeley and Houses 1993 study of sophomore and junior transfer students at 

Northern Illinois University analyzed transfer shock (p. 2) for students matriculating 

from community colleges. The researchers found students who transferred from a 

community college obtained a grade point average significantly lower in their first 

semester than did students who began their college career at a 4-year institution. 

However, the results of the longitudinal studies showed that transfer students who 

persisted to graduation showed an equivalent GPA at baccalaureate completion (Keeley 

& House, 1993).  

Students who transferred from occupationally oriented degree programs typically 

were not included in traditional studies of transfer students. While the research in general 

does not include AAS students in traditional transfer data, limited conclusions were 

available comparing AAS students to traditional 4-year college attendees. Townsends 

study at the University of Missouri-Columbia (2002) showed no difference in grades at 

baccalaureate graduation between students with an AA/AS degree and students with an 

AAS degree.  

The use of grades as an indicator of the level of student achievement has been 

relied upon by studies comparing traditional classroom instruction and distance 

instruction. Research analyzing the effectiveness of student learning in distance education 

began with the first correspondence courses offered utilizing the mail service (Russell, 

1999). The study of effectiveness of correspondence courses expanded to include new 

technologies, such as television and video courses, and increased with the proliferation of 


 
23 

online educational offerings. Researchers continued to challenge the effectiveness of 

learning methods not delivered in traditional higher education settings. 

In 1991, Russell reviewed over 355 studies, dating from the 1930s and continuing 

through the late 1980s, and found no significant difference in student learning using any 

form of distance education, as compared with students in classroom-based instruction 

(Russell, 1999). Russells conclusion formed the basis for a series of works collectively 

known as No Significant Difference. Russells conclusion from his studies follows: 

The fact is the findings of comparative studies are absolutely conclusive; one can 

bank on them. No matter how it is produced, how it is delivered, whether or not it 

is interactive, low tech or high tech, students learn equally well with each 

technology and learn as well as their on-campus, face-to-face counterparts even 

though students would rather be on campus with the instructor if that were a real 

choice. (p. xviii) 

Overwhelmingly, studies have supported Russells conclusions, including 

Neuhausers (2002) study of traditional face-to-face education and online education in a 

business communications class at a large urban university in North Carolina. Neuhauser 

concluded there was no significant difference in pre- and post-test scores of students 

enrolled in online and traditional communications classes. In addition, Neuhauser found 

no significant difference in final grades, homework grades, and grades on research 

papers, even though learners in the online course were significantly older than were 

learners in the traditional face-to-face section.  

The Summers et al. (2005) research included a comparison of student 

achievement and satisfaction in an online versus a traditional face-to-face statistics class. 


24 

The study, conducted at the University of Missouri-Columbia, included undergraduate 

nursing students who were tested on both their pre- and post-course knowledge of 

statistics. Their results indicated that utilizing grades as an indicator of knowledge 

showed no significant difference between the online and traditional classroom students. 

In their meta-analysis, Machtmes and Asher (2002) reviewed 30 studies and concluded 

there did not appear to be a difference in achievement, as measured by grades, between 

distance and traditional learners. 

As technology use continued to evolve in online education, various studies were 

conducted to determine whether different delivery methods created a difference in the 

grades of online students compared to their face-to-face counterparts. A study conducted 

by Carmel and Gold (2007) supported Russells original conclusion by analyzing specific 

types of online platforms and delivery models. Carmel and Golds study included hybrid 

and traditional classroom-based instruction. They analyzed results from 164 students in 

110 courses and found no significant difference in student achievement based on grades 

between students enrolled in either delivery method.  

Additional studies supporting Russells theory have crossed multiple content 

areas and delivery models. Brown and Liedholms (2002) study at Michigan State 

University included microeconomics students in virtual, hybrid, and traditional 

classroom-based instruction. The study included 389 students in the traditional setting, 

258 in the hybrid delivery section and 89 students enrolled in online education.  No 

significant difference in student learning as measured by end of course grades was found. 

Research also showed type of course discipline is not affected by the online 

delivery model. Schulman and Simms (1999) compared pretest and posttest scores of 


25 

students enrolled in an online course and a traditional course at Nova Southeastern 

University. The researchers compared 40 undergraduate students enrolled in online 

courses and 59 undergraduate students enrolled in the classroom setting of the same 

course. Results indicated that the students who select online courses scored higher than 

traditional students scored on the pretest results. However, posttest results showed no 

significant difference for the online students versus the in-class students. Schulman and 

Simms concluded that online students were learning equally as well as their classroom-

based counterparts. Reigles (2007) analysis across disciplines at the University of San 

Francisco and the University of California found no significant difference between online 

and face-to-face student grade attainment. 

Shachar and Neumann (2003) conducted a meta-analysis that estimated and 

compared the differences between the academic performance of students enrolled in 

distance education compared to those enrolled in traditional settings over the period from 

1990-2002. Eighty-six studies containing data from over 15,000 participating students 

were included in their analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that in two-thirds 

of the cases, students taking courses by distance education outperformed their student 

counterparts enrolled in traditionally instructed courses.  

Lynch, during the use of the Tegrity system, a brand-specific online platform at 

Louisiana State University, found that students grades were slightly better after utilizing 

the technology than when the traditional approach was used (Lynch, 2002). Initial results 

of a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study of 5000 students over 2 years indicated 

that the U-Pace online students performed 12% better than their traditional Psychology 

101 counterparts on the same cumulative test (Perez, 2009). Arles (2002) study found 


26 

students enrolled in online human anatomy courses at Rio Salado College scored an 

average of 6.3% higher on assessments than the national achievement average. Students 

were assessed using a national standardized test generated by the Human Anatomy and 

Physiology Society, whose norming sample is based entirely on traditional classroom 

delivery (Arle, 2002).  

In a study conducted by Stephenson, Brown, and Griffin (2008), comparing three 

different delivery styles (traditional, asynchronous electronic courseware, and 

synchronous e-lectures), results indicated no increased effectiveness of any delivery style 

when all question types were taken into account. However, when results were analyzed, 

students receiving traditional lectures showed the lowest levels on questions designed to 

assess comprehension.  

Research found supporters in higher education academic leaders. In a 2006 survey 

of Midwestern postsecondary institutions concerning their online offerings, 56 % of 

academic leaders in the 11 states rated the learning outcomes in online education as the 

same or superior to those in face-to-face instructional settings. The proportion of higher 

education institutions believing that online learning outcomes were superior to those for 

face-to-face outcomes was still relatively small, but had grown by 34% since 2003, from 

10.2 to 13.7 % (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). This belief added merit to the conclusions 

supported by Russell and others. 

Russells (1999) no significant difference conclusion had its detractors. The 

most commonly cited is Phipps and Merisotis (1999), who reviewed Russells original 

meta-analysis (1999) and reported a much different conclusion. They concluded that the 

overall quality of the original research was questionable, that much of the research did 


27 

not control for extraneous variables, and therefore it could not show cause and effect. 

They included in their findings evidence that the studies utilized by Russell (2000) in the 

meta-analysis did not use randomly selected subjects, did not take into effect the 

differences among students, and did not include tests of validity and reliability.  

The  Phipps and Merisotis (1999) analysis included the conclusion that research 

has focused too much on individual courses rather than on academic programs, and has 

not taken into account differences among students. They postulated that based on these 

conclusions, there is a significant difference in the learning results, as evidenced by 

grades, of students participating in distance education as compared to their classroom-

based peers. Their analysis of Russells original work questioned both the quality and 

effectiveness of research comparing distance and traditional education delivery.  

While there has been ongoing conjecture that online education students are not 

receiving an equivalent learning experience compared to their traditional classroom 

counterparts, studies utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning have produced 

little evidence of the disparity. The incidence of studies showing significant negative 

differences in grades of online learners is small. Higher education institutions have 

indicated their support for online education, and its continued growth has allowed studies 

such as the present research to contribute to ongoing dialogue. 

Student Retention in Postsecondary Education 

Persistence and retention in higher education is an issue that has intrigued 

researchers for over 50 years. Quantitative studies conducted in the mid-20th century 

produced data that caused researchers to look at low retention rates in higher education 


28 

and search for answers. This question has continued to consume researchers and higher 

education institutions. 

In 1987, Tinto attempted to summarize studies of individual student retention in 

higher education by proposing a theory to allow higher education administrators to 

predict success and support students (Tinto, 1987). Tintos model of student engagement 

has been in use for over 20 years as higher education administrators and faculty attempt 

to explain student retention issues at universities and colleges. Tintos model primarily 

focused on factors of student engagement: How students respond to instructors, the 

higher education community itself, and students own engagement in learning are the 

primary factors Tinto theorized as determining the students retention. In the concluding 

remarks to his 1987 treatise on retention, Tinto acknowledged that persistence in higher 

education is but one facet of human growth and development, and one that cannot 

necessarily be attributed to a single factor or strategy. 

Tintos (1987) original study of student retention included the observation that 

student retention is a complicated web of events that shape student leaving and 

persistence. He observed that the view of student retention had changed since the 1950s, 

when students were thought to leave due to lack of motivation, persistence, and skills, 

hence the name dropout. In the 1970s, research began to focus on the role of the 

environment in student decisions to stay or leave. In the 1990s, Tinto proposed that the 

actions of the faculty were the key to institutional efforts to enhance student retention 

(Tinto, 2007). This was a significant addition to his theory, placing the cause on the 

instructor instead of the student, and it has done much to influence retention strategies 


29 

utilized in higher education institutions (Tinto, 2007). Tintos studies have driven 

research in both traditional retention studies and those involving distance education.  

Studies of the persistence of the postsecondary student routinely focus on 4-year 

postsecondary education. It is only within the last 20 years that persistence studies have 

included community college students and occupational students, acknowledging that their 

reasons for entering the postsecondary community are different from the traditional 4-

year higher education participant (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). With different avenues to a 

baccalaureate degree more prevalent, the research into college persistence has expanded 

to include other types of programs and students. 

Postsecondary student retention rates routinely utilize data from longitudinal 

studies of students entering in a Fall semester and completing a bachelors program no 

more than 6 years later (NCES, 2003). The National Center for Education Statistics 

reported that 55% of those seeking a baccalaureate degree would complete in 6 years 

(NCES, 2003). The report acknowledged institutions are unable to follow students who 

transfer to other institutions; they are able to report only the absence of enrollment in 

their own institution.  

Research has also found a large gap between community college entrants and 4-

year college entrants in rates of attaining a bachelors degree. Dougherty (1992) reported 

that students entering community college receive 11 to 19% fewer bachelors degrees 

than students beginning at a 4-year university. Dougherty postulated that the lower 

baccalaureate attainment rate of community college entrants was attributable to both their 

individual traits and the institution they entered (Dougherty, 1992). 


30 

Studies of student retention of community college also vary based on the types of 

students. Community college retention rates are routinely reported as lower than 

traditional 4-year institutions (NCES, 2007). Cohen and Brawer (1996) attributed the 

differences in retention to the difference in the mission. In many instances, students did 

not enroll in a community college in order to attain a degree (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). 

The most recent longitudinal study in 1993 showed a retention rate of 55.4% of students 

after 3 years (NCES, 2001).  

Of community college students, only 60.9% indicated a desire to transfer later to a 

baccalaureate degree completion program (NCES, 2003). While retention data collected 

by the federal government (NCES, 2003) did not include students with an AAS degree, 

Townsends studies of the transfer rates and baccalaureate attainment rates of students in 

Missouri who had completed an Associate of Arts and students who had completed an 

Associate of Applied Science degree was 61% compared to 54% (Townsend, 2001).  

Vocational or occupational programs have reported retention rates as program 

completion, a definition involving completion of specific tasks and competencies 

instead of grades and tied to a limited program length. This state and federal requirement 

indicates program quality and ensures continued federal funding. In 2001, the U.S. 

Department of Education reported a 60.1% completion rate of postsecondary students 

enrolled in occupational education (NCES, 2007). Until 1995, the reasons for students 

leaving was neither delineated nor reported; it was not until federal reporting 

requirements under the Carl Perkins Act of 1994 that institutions were required to explore 

why students were not retained in vocational programs (P.L. 105-332). 


31 

Distance education provided a new arena for the study of student persistence. 

Theorists and researchers have attempted to utilize Tintos model of student persistence 

to explain retention issues involved with distance education. However, Rovai (2003) 

analyzed the differing student characteristics of distance learners as compared to the 

traditional students targeted by Tintos original models and concluded that student 

retention theories proposed from that population were no longer applicable to distance 

education learners. Rovai proposed that distance educators could address retention in 

ways that traditional higher education has not. He suggested that distance educators 

utilize strategies such as capitalizing on students expectations of technology, addressing 

economic benefits and specific educational needs to increase student retention in courses 

(Rovai, 2003). 

The expanded use of technology created a distinct subset of research into student 

retention issues. In 2004, Berge and Huang developed an overview of models of student 

retention, with special emphasis on models developed to explain the retention rates in 

distance education. Their studies primarily focused on the variables in student 

demographics and external factors, such as age and gender, which influence persistence 

and retention in online learning. Berge and Huang found that traditional models of 

student retention such as Tintos did not acknowledge the differences in student 

expectations and goals that are ingrained in the students selection of the online learning 

option. 

Other researchers have attempted to study retention issues specifically for online 

education. In a meta-analysis, Nora and Snyder (2009) found the majority of studies of 

online education focused on students individual characteristics and individual 


32 

perceptions of technology. Nora and Snyder concluded that researchers attempt to utilize 

traditional models of student engagement to explain student retention issues in distance or 

online learning courses, with little or no success. This supported Berge and Huards 

conclusions. Nora and Snyder (2009) also noted a dearth of quantitative research.  

Few quantitative studies exist that support higher or equal retention in online 

students compared to their classroom-based counterparts. One example is the Carmel and 

Gold (2007) study. They found no significant difference in student retention rates 

between students in distance education courses and their traditional classroom-based 

counterparts. The study utilized data from 164 students, 95 enrolled in classroom-based 

courses and 69 enrolled in a hybrid online format. Participants randomly self-selected and 

were not all enrolled in the same course, introducing variables not attributed in the study.  

The majority of quantitative studies instead concluded there is a higher retention 

rate in traditional classrooms than in distance education. In the Phipps and Merisotis 

(1999) review of Russells original research, which included online education, results 

indicated that research has shown even lower retention rates in online students than in 

students attending classes in the traditional college setting. The high dropout rate among 

distance education students was not addressed in Russells meta-analysis, and Phipps and 

Merisotis found no suitable explanation in the research. They postulated that the 

decreased retention rate documented within distance education studies skews 

achievement data by excluding the dropouts. 

Diaz (2002) found a high drop rate for online students compared to traditional 

classroom-based students in an online health education course at Nova Southeastern. 

Other studies have supported the theory that retention of online students is far below that 


33 

of the traditional campus students. In 2002, Carr, reporting for The Chronicle of Higher 

Education, noted that online courses routinely lose 50 % of students who originally 

enrolled, as compared to a retention rate of 70-75% of traditional face-to-face students. 

Carr reported dropout rates of up to 75% in online courses as a likely indicator of the 

difficultly faced in retaining distance education students who do not routinely meet with 

faculty. The data have not been refuted. 

As community colleges began utilizing distance education, retention rates were 

reported as higher than traditional students (Nash, 1984). However, the California 

Community College System report for Fall 2008 courses showed inconsistent retention 

results for distance education learners, varying by the type of course. Results indicated 

equivalent retention rates for online instruction compared to traditional coursework in the 

majority of courses. Lower retention rates were indicated in online engineering, social 

sciences, and mathematics courses as compared to traditional classroom instructional 

models (California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, 2009). 

Due to the limited number of vocational/technical or occupational courses taught 

in the online mode, there was little data on student retention. In 1997, Hogan studied 

technical course and program completion of students in distance and traditional 

vocational education and found that course completion rates were higher for distance 

education students. However, program completion rates were higher for traditional 

students than for students enrolled in distance education (Hogan, 1997).  

In summary, studies of retention have focused primarily on student characteristics 

while acknowledging that postsecondary retention rates vary according to a variety of 

factors. Research showed mixed results concerning the retention rate of online students, 


34 

though quantitative data leans heavily toward a lower course retention rate in online 

students. Data from 4-year universities have shown lower retention rates for online 

students than for traditional face-to-face students, while community colleges have shown 

inconsistent results. Data from vocational-technical education has been limited, but 

course retention rates are higher for online students, while program retention rates are 

lower. No significant research factor affecting retention has been isolated between 

students in online baccalaureate completion programs and students participating in 

traditional classroom-based settings. 

Summary 

Research studies have been conducted analyzing student retention in higher 

education, transfer and retention of students from community colleges to universities, the 

impact of distance education, and student achievement and retention factors related to 

distance education. However, no comparative research was identified that compared the 

achievement and retention of students participating in an occupationally oriented transfer 

program utilizing both online education and traditional classroom-based instruction. 

Chapter Three addresses the topics of research design, hypotheses, and research 

questions. Additionally, population and sample, data collection, and data analysis are 

discussed.

CHAPTER THREE 

METHODOLOGY 

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a significant difference 

between course grades of students enrolled in online Technology Administration courses 

and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The study also examined if there is a 

significant difference between course retention and program retention of students 

enrolled in online Technology Administration courses and their traditional classroom-

based counterparts. The methodology employed to test the research hypotheses is 

presented in this chapter. The chapter is organized into the following sections: research 

design, hypotheses and research questions, population and sample, data collection, data 

analysis, and summary. 

Research Design 

A quantitative, quasi-experimental research design was selected to study grades, 

course retention, and program retention in students enrolled in the Technology 

Administration program. The design was chosen as a means to determine if significant 

differences occur between online and face-to-face students by examining numerical 

scores from all participants enrolled, and retention rates in both courses and programs in 

the Technology Administration program.  

Hypotheses and Research Questions 

This study focused on three research questions with accompanying hypotheses. 

The research questions and hypotheses guiding the study follow. 


 
 
36 

Research Question 1: Is there is a statistically significant difference between 

students grades in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

H1: There is a statistically significant difference in course grades of students 

participating in online courses and students enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at 

the 0.05 level of significance.  

Research Question 2: Is there a statistically significant difference between course 

retention rate of students in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

H2: There is a statistically significant difference in student course retention 

between students participating in online courses and students enrolled in face-to-face 

courses at the 0.05 level of significance.  

Research Question 3: Is there a statistically significant difference in program 

retention between students who entered the program in online classes and students who 

entered the program in traditional face-to-face classes? 

H3: There is a statistically significant difference in program retention between 

students who begin the Technology Administration program in online courses and 

students who begin in face-to-face courses at the 0.05 level of significance. 

Population and Sample 

The two populations selected were students enrolled in online and face-to-face 

courses. The sample included students enrolled in Technology Administration courses. 

Student enrollment was analyzed for all Technology Administration courses in the 

program sequence to determine the number of samples available in online and face-to-

face classes. The course enrollment data for the sample are outlined in Table E1. The 

subsample of the data utilized for the study is presented in Table 1.

CHAPTER ONE 

INTRODUCTION 

Historically, postsecondary education in the United States was founded on the 

principles of the European system, requiring the physical presence of professors and 

students in the same location (Knowles, 1994). From 1626, with the founding of Harvard 

University (The Harvard Guide, 2004), to the development of junior colleges and 

vocational schools in the early 1900s (Cohen & Brawer, 1996; Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), 

the higher education system developed to prepare post-high school students for one of 

three separate tiers. The college and university system in the United States developed its 

own set of structures designed to prepare students for baccalaureate and graduate degrees. 

Junior colleges were limited to associate degrees, while vocational education institutions 

offered occupational certificates. In many cases, there was inadequate recognition of the 

postsecondary education offered at junior colleges and vocational education institutions, 

resulting in the inability of students to transfer to 4-year institutions (National Center for 

Education Statistics, 2006).  

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges began to provide academic, 

vocational, and personal development educational offerings for members of the local 

communities. During this same period, junior or community colleges developed a role as 

transfer institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or 

distance, could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & 

Brawer, 1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs involved Associate 

of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Associate of Applied Science 

(AAS) degrees were developed during the 1990s. The AAS degree was granted to those 


2 

who successfully completed the majority of their college program in vocational 

education. The creation of a variety of applied baccalaureate degrees allowed students 

who had previously thought of the AAS degree as a terminal program to complete a 

baccalaureate degree (Kansas Board of Regents, 2002-2003).  

Online education also became a strategy for students to access higher education in 

the 1990s (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). The proliferation of online courses alleviated some 

of the location-bound barriers to higher education, but online education was criticized as 

less rigorous than traditional classroom-based course work by traditional academicians. 

Russell attempted to address this argument with his 1999 meta-analysis of studies dating 

from the 1920s and covering multiple delivery models, including online education. 

Russell concluded there was no statistically significant difference in student achievement 

between courses offered online and those offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

Since the development of correspondence courses in the 1920s, researchers have 

attempted to ascertain if students participating in distance education are being 

shortchanged in their educational goals. No significant difference in grades has been 

found in the majority of studies designed to address this issue. Studies analyzing online 

student retention have shown significantly lower retention for online students.  In the last 

10 years, research studies have expanded to include variations of online education. These 

include strictly online, hybrid courses, Web-assisted classroom settings, and the 

traditional higher education course offered only as face-to-face instruction (Carmel & 

Gold, 2007).  

Online education continues to proliferate at the same time the number of 

secondary students in the United States overall is projected to increase (National Center 


3 

for Education Statistics [NCES], 2006). The projected increase of potential postsecondary 

students and online postsecondary options provides opportunities for increases in online 

education programs and courses. In 2000, NCES reported that over 65% of students in 

higher education were participating in online courses. In a 2007 study, Allen and Seaman 

estimated only 16% of those enrolled in online education courses are undergraduate 

students seeking their first degree, counter to the projected increase in traditional-age 

students. The majority of enrollees in online education are adults updating or advancing 

their credentials, creating an additional educational market for colleges and universities 

seeking to expand enrollment without adding physical space (Allen & Seaman, 2007a). 

For states and localities faced with a contradictory traditional-age enrollment decrease, 

these figures present an untapped market for higher education courses and programs. 

Background 

Researchers attempted to analyze the efficacy of distance education as far back as 

the 1920s when correspondence courses were created to meet the need of students not 

willing to attend a traditional classroom-based higher education setting. A meta-analysis 

of these studies resulted in The No Significant Difference Phenomenon, reported by 

Russell (2001). The results of over 355 studies were compiled, comparing various modes 

of delivery including correspondence, audio, television courses, and the newest wave of 

computer-facilitated instruction. Following analyses of studies completed prior to 2001, 

Russell concluded there was no difference in learning between students enrolled in 

distance education and those completing courses in the traditional setting.  

Studies completed since then have provided mixed results. Summers, Waigand, 

and Whittaker (2005) found there was no difference in GPA and retention between the 


4 

online and traditional classroom. Arle (2002) found higher achievement by online 

students, and Brown and Liedholm (2002) found GPA and student retention better in a 

traditional classroom setting.  

Student retention is an integral part of the student achievement conversation and 

is an issue for all forms of higher education. Degree-seeking students overall retention 

has been reported as less than 56% by NCES (2001). Long considered a problem in 

higher education, attention to the distance education model has shown even lower 

retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college 

setting (Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). Research on different modalities, such as fully 

online and hybrid online courses, has produced mixed results (Carmel & Gold, 2007). No 

significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities 

has been documented.  

Retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined 

students transfering from a community college. Statistics have consistantly shown a 

lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a 4-year 

university than for students who began their post-high school education at a 4-year 

institution (NCES, 2006). Townsends studies of transfer students at the University of 

Missouri-Columbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who 

had completed an AAS degree than for students beginning their education at a 4-year 

institution (Townsend, 2002). 

Occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively 

new to higher education. Transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges 

to 4-year institutions were common by the 1990s. Townsend (2001), in her study 


 
5 

conducted at the University of MissouriColumbia, observed the blurring of the lines 

between non-transferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and 

undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred. The study conducted 

by Townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their 

education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that 

grew after their completion of an occupationally-oriented degree. Laanan proposed that 

the increase in institutions offering AAS degrees necessitated new ways to transfer 

undergraduate credits (2003).  

The setting of this study is a medium-sized Midwestern campus located in 

Topeka, Kansas. Washburn University enrolls approximately 6000 students a year in 

undergraduate and graduate programs, including liberal arts, professional schools, and a 

law school (Washburn University, 2008). The Technology Administration (TA) program 

selected for the present study began in the 1990s as a baccalaureate degree completion 

program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a 

Kansas community college or through Washburns articulation agreement with Kansas 

vocational-technical schools. This program provided students who previously had 

obtained an Associate of Applied Science degree in an occupational area an opportunity 

to earn a bachelors degree. 

Peterson, Dean of Continuing Education, Washburn University, stated that in 

early 1999, Washburn University began online courses and programs at the behest of a 

neighboring community college (personal communication, April 18, 2008). Washburn 

was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students 

graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an Associate of Applied 


6 

Science degree. The TA program was among the first programs to offer the online 

bachelors degree completion option. The TA program offered its first online courses in 

Spring 2000.  

Online education at Washburn expanded to other programs and courses, to 

include over 200 courses (Washburn University, 2008). The original online partnership 

with two community colleges expanded to include 16 additional community colleges and 

four technical colleges in Kansas, as well as colleges in Missouri, California, Wisconsin, 

South Carolina, and Nebraska (Washburn University, 2008). 

An initial study in 2002 of students course grades and retention in online courses 

offered at Washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face course work (Peterson,  personal 

communication, April 18, 2008). No studies of program retention have been completed.  

In 2008, Atkins reported overall enrollment at Washburn University decreased 

6.7% from Fall 2004 to Fall 2008, from 7400 to 6901 students. During the same period, 

online course enrollment patterns increased 65%, from 3550 students to 5874 in 2007-

2008 (Washburn University, 2008). Atkins also reported that between 1998 and 2008, the 

ratio of traditional post-high school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at 

Washburn University reversed from 40:60 to 60:40. The shift in enrollment patterns 

produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the 21st century; however, 

Washburn University anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in Kansas through 

2016, based on demographic patterns of the state. The state figures are opposite the 

anticipated increase of traditional-age students nationally (NCES, 2008). The increase in 


distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditional-age 

students provided the focus for the study. 

7 

Purpose of the Study 

Online education has become an important strategy for the higher education 

institution that was the setting of this study. First, the purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students 

participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The 

second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference 

between course retention of students participating in TA online courses and their 

traditional classroom-based counterparts. The second part of the study was a replication 

of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroom-based 

instruction (Carmel & Gold, 2007; Russell, 1999). A third purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who 

began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in 

traditional face-to-face courses. The studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base 

concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree 

completion opportunities. 

Research Questions 

Roberts (2004) stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the 

structure for presenting the results of the research. The research questions guiding this 

study were: 


 
8 

1. 

Is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in 

online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

2. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates 

in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

3. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for 

students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students 

entering the program enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes? 

Overview of the Methodology 

A quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course, course retention, 

and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-face TA 

program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at Washburn 

University were utilized from comparative online and traditional face-to-face classes in 

two separate courses. In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of 885 students 

enrolled in online and traditional face-to-face courses was identified. The sample 

included students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 

and 2006 in both the online and traditional face-to-face classes. Two instructors were 

responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-to-face classes for the 

period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential 

difference in the dependent variables, course grades due to delivery method (online and 

face-to-face), instructor (instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the 

two independent variables (Research Question 1). A chi-square test for differences 

among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention (Research 

Questions 2 and 3).  


 
9 

Delimitations 

Roberts (2004) defined delimitations as the boundaries of the study that are 

controlled principally by the researcher. The delimitations for this study were 

1. 

Only data from 2002 through 2008 from Technology Administration 

online and face-to-face courses were utilized. 

2. 

The study was confined to students enrolled at Washburn University in the 

Technology Administration program. 

3. 

Only grades and retention were analyzed. 

Assumptions 

Assumptions are defined as those things presupposed in a study (Roberts, 2004). 

The study was based on the following assumptions: 

1. 

Delivery of content was consistent between online and face-to-face 

courses and instructors, 

2. 

Course objectives were the same for paired online and traditional face-to-

face courses,  

3. 

All students enrolled in the TA program met the same criteria for 

4. 

5. 

admission to the University,  

All data entered in the Excel spreadsheets were correct, 

All students enrolled in the TA program met the same criteria for grade 

point average and program prerequisites. 


 
 
 
 
Definitions 

10 

The following terms are defined for the purpose of this study: 

Distance education. Education or training courses delivered to remote locations 

via postal delivery, or broadcast by audio, video, or computer technologies (Allen, 2007).  

Dropout. A dropout is defined as a student who has left school and discontinued 

studies (Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 1998).  

Face-to-face delivery. This is a course that uses no online technology; content is 

delivered in person, either in written or oral form (Allen, 2007). 

Hybrid course. This course is a blend of the online and face-to-face course. A 

substantial proportion of the content is delivered online, typically using some online 

discussions and some face-to-face meetings (Allen, 2007). 

Online course. This defines a course where most or all of the content is delivered 

online via computer technologies. Typically, there are no face-to-face meetings (Allen, 

2007). 

2+2 PLAN. The Partnership for Learning and Networking is a collaborative set of 

online 2+2 baccalaureate degree programs developed by Washburn University. The 

programs require completion of an associate degree from one of the partner community 

or technical colleges (Washburn University, 2008).  

Retention. This term refers to the completion of a course by receiving a letter 

grade in a course, or a certificate of completion or degree for program completion 

(Washburn University, 2008).  

Web-assisted. A course that uses Web-based technology to facilitate what is 

essentially a face-to-face course (Allen, 2007).

12 

CHAPTER TWO 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

This chapter presents the background for research into the efficacy of distance 

education in the delivery of higher education. Research studies have focused primarily on 

grades as a measure of the quality of distance education courses as compared to 

traditional face-to-face instruction. Utilizing grades has produced a dividing line among 

education researchers concerning the use of distance education as a delivery model. 

Retention in distance education has focused primarily on single courses, with little 

program retention data available. Data from retention studies in higher education have 

focused primarily on the traditional 4-year university student. Retention studies of 

community college students have produced quantitative results; however, these studies 

have been directed at community college students who identify themselves as transfer 

students early in their community college careers. Retention studies of students enrolled 

in occupationally oriented programs are limited. 

Statistical data of higher education shows an increased use of distance education 

for traditional academic courses as well as occupationally oriented courses. The increase 

in distance education courses and programs has provided a new dimension to studies of 

both grades and retention. The recognition of this increase, as well as questions 

concerning its impact on student learning and retention, produced the impetus for this 

study. 

The following review of the literature represents the literature related to this 

research study. Through examination of previous research, the direction of the present 

study was formulated. Specifically, the chapter is organized into four sections: (a) the 


13 

history of occupational transfer programs; (b) the history and research of distance 

education, including occupational transfer programs utilizing distance education; (c) 

research utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning in online education; and (d) 

research focusing on student retention in higher education, including student retention 

issues in transfer education and online transfer courses and programs. 

History of Occupational Transfer Programs 

The measure of success in higher education has been characterized as the 

attainment of a bachelors degree at a 4-year university. Occupationally oriented 

education was considered primarily a function of job preparation, and until the 1990s was 

not considered transferrable to other higher education institutions. Occupational transfer 

programs are a recent occurrence within the postsecondary system that provides an 

additional pathway to bachelors degree completion.  

Historically, the postsecondary experience in the United States developed as a 

three-track system. Colleges were established in the United States in 1636 with the 

founding of Harvard College (The Harvard Guide, 2004). Junior colleges were first 

founded in 1901 as experimental post-high school graduate programs (Joliet Junior 

College History, 2008). Their role was initially as a transfer institution to the university. 

When the Smith-Hughes Act was passed in 1917, a system of vocational education was 

born in the United States (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), and was designed to provide further 

education to those students not viewed as capable of success in a university setting. 

Vocational education, currently referred to as occupational or technical education, 

was not originally designed to be a path to higher education. The first programs were 

designed to help agricultural workers complete their education and increase their skills. 


14 

More vocational programs were developed during the early 20th century as 

industrialization developed and as increasing numbers of skills were needed by workers 

in blue-collar occupations (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003). 

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges expanded their programs beyond 

academic selections to provide occupational development and continuing education. 

Because of the geographic area from which they attracted students, junior colleges 

developed a role as community colleges. They also solidified their role as transfer 

institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or distance, 

could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & Brawer, 

1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs to 4-year universities 

involved traditional academic degrees, including the Associate of Arts (AA) and 

Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Occupational programs and continuing education 

were viewed as terminal and non-transferrable. 

In 1984, Congress authorized the Carl Perkins Vocational and Technical 

Education Act (P.L. 98-524). In the legislation, Congress responded to employers 

concerns about the lack of basic skills in employees by adding academic requirements to 

vocational education legislation. Vocational program curriculum was expanded to include 

language arts, mathematics, and science principles, and the curriculum reflected the 

context of the program. The Secretarys Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills 

(SCANS) was created in 1990 to determine the skills young people need to succeed in the 

world of work (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). In the second Carl Perkins 

reauthorization in 1990 (P.L. 105-332), Congress responded to the report, which targeted 

academic and job skills, by outlining a seamless system of vocational and academic 


15 

education to prepare vocational students to progress into and through higher education. 

This emphasis led to the development of Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees 

during the 1990s. Granted to those who have successfully completed programs in the 

applied arts and sciences for careers, AAS degrees were seen as terminal (Kansas Board 

of Regents, 2002-2003). 

But as one goal was attained, conversation turned to creating a pathway from 

occupational associate degrees to bachelors degree completion. The desire of students to 

continue from technical degrees to a baccalaureate was not a new idea. In a paper 

presented in 1989 to the American Technical Association national conference, Troutt-

Ervin and Morgans overview of 2+2 programs showed acceptance of AAS degrees at 

traditional universities was generally non-existent. Their suggestion for an academic 

bridge from early technical education to baccalaureate programs highlighted programs 

accepting AAS degrees toward baccalaureate completion were an exception rather than a 

rule (Troutt-Ervin & Morgan, 1989). It was not until the late 1990s that applied 

baccalaureate degrees recognized credits from technical degree students who had 

previously thought of themselves in a terminal program to complete their baccalaureate 

degree (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the advance of recognition of AAS degrees, standard definitions of 

transfer students continued to exclude students who completed technical programs. The 

U.S. Department of Education did not include students receiving an Associate of Applied 

Science degree in the definition of students preparing for transfer to 4-year colleges 

(Bradburn, Hurst, & Peng, 2001; Carnevale, 2006). Most states had comparable policies 

in place concerning core academic curriculum, articulation agreements, transfer of credit, 


16 

and statewide transfer guides. There was no general recognition of occupational credit 

transfer. Only a few states, including Kansas, Missouri, and Washington, allowed credits 

earned in occupationally oriented degrees to transfer to 4-year institutions (Townsend, 

2001). No state had set clear goals for the transference of occupational credits between 

institutions or for the state as a whole (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the lack of recognition of occupational transfer credit at the federal level, 

a new definition of transfer education had emerged. Initially defined as the general 

education component of the first 2 years of a baccalaureate, the definition of transfer 

education now included any courses that transferred to a 4-year college, regardless of the 

nature of the courses (Townsend, 2001).  

The line between vocational schools, community colleges, and 4-year institutions 

blurred in the United States as employers and students increasingly made business 

decisions regarding education and workforce development. Employers increasingly asked 

for employees with academic and technical skills, as well as critical thinking skills and 

personal responsibility (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). Returning students themselves 

were more attuned to the demands of the 21st century workforce. Their desire to return to 

higher education, coupled with the economy and the variety of options available to them, 

required a more adaptive higher education system (Carnevale, 2006). There was growing 

demand among new and returning students for higher education opportunities responsive 

to their needs. The expanding needs of the returning student provided opportunities for 

higher education to respond by utilizing different delivery models. 


 
 
17 

Distance Education 

Online education became a strategy for postsecondary institutions when the first 

correspondence courses were initiated with the mail service in the early 20th century 

(Russell, 1999). As various technologies emerged, distance education utilized television 

and video models, in addition to paper-based correspondence courses. The expansion of 

distance education utilizing computer technologies renewed academic debate over the 

efficacy of the delivery model. 

Online education utilizing the Internet became a significant factor in the 1990s, 

prompting renewed evaluation of the use of distance learning opportunities (Russell, 

1999, Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). In 19992000, the number of students who took any 

distance education courses was 8.4% of total undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary 

education (NCES, 2000). In 2000, the report of the Web-Based Education Commission to 

the President and Congress concluded that the Internet was no longer in question as a tool 

to transform the way teaching and learning was offered. The Commission recommended 

that the nation embrace E-learning as a strategy to provide on-demand, high-quality 

teaching and professional development to keep the United States competitive in the 

global workforce. They also recommended continued funding of research into teaching 

and learning utilizing web-based resources (Web-Based Education Commission, 2000). 

The acceptance of the importance of the Internet for delivery of higher education opened 

new opportunities for research and continued the academic debate of the quality of 

instruction delivered in online education courses and programs. 

In a longitudinal study from 2002-2007, The Sloan Consortium, a group of higher 

education institutions actively involved in online education, began studies of online 


18 

education in the United States over a period of 5 years. In the first study, researchers 

Allen and Seaman (2003) conducted polls of postsecondary institutions involved with 

online education and found that students overwhelming responded to the availability of 

online education, with over 1.6 million students taking at least one online course during 

the Fall semester of 2002. Over one third of these students took all of their courses 

online. The survey also found that in 2002, 81% of all institutions of higher education 

offered at least one fully online or blended course (Allen & Seaman, 2003). 

In their intermediate report in 2005, Allen and Seaman postulated that online 

education had continued to make inroads in postsecondary education, with 65% of 

schools offering graduate courses and programs face-to-face also offering graduate 

courses online. Sixty-three percent of undergraduate institutions offering face-to-face 

courses also offered courses online. From 2003 to 2005, the survey results showed that 

online education, as a long-term strategy for institutions, had increased from 49% to 56%. 

In addition, core education online course offerings had increased (Allen & Seaman, 

2005). 

In Allen and Seamans final report (2007b) for the Sloan Consortium, the 

researchers reported that almost 3.5 million students participated in at least one online 

course during the Fall 2006 term, a nearly 10% increase over the number reported in the 

previous year. Allen and Seaman also reported a 9.7% increase in online enrollment, 

compared to the 1.5% growth in overall higher education. They found by 2007, 2-year 

institutions had the highest growth rates and accounted for over the half the online 

enrollments in the previous 5 years. The researchers concluded, based on a survey 


 
 
19 

conducted as part of the research, institutions believed that improved student access was 

the top reason for offering online courses and programs (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). 

Community colleges began embracing distance education in the 1920s as part of 

their mission to provide low-cost, time-effective education. Community colleges initially 

provided correspondence courses by mail, but later switched to television and video 

courses as technology improved (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). In 2001, over 90% of public 2-

year colleges in the United States provided distance education courses over the Internet 

(NCES, 2001).  

Vocational education, by the nature of its instructional format, was among the last 

of the educational institutions to participate in distance education. Because of the 

kinesthetic nature of instruction, vocational education leaders began investigating 

distance education opportunities in the 1990s, relying on the method to provide only the 

lecture portion of instruction. By 2004, only 31% of students enrolled in vocational 

schools had participated in some form of distance education during their program of 

study (NCES, 2005). In 2008, hands-on instruction in programs such as automobile 

mechanics and welding, and the clinical portion of health occupations programs, 

continued to be taught in the traditional classroom setting (NCES, 2008). 

Analysis of data reported by the NCES indicated that distance education had 

become a staple for higher education institutions. At both the 4-year and 2-year university 

level, over 65% of institutions offered more than 12 million courses in 2006-2007 by 

distance education. While vocational education had traditionally been more hands-on, 

distance education had become more prevalent in providing opportunities for students to 

participate in components of the system over the Internet (NCES, 2008).  


 
 
 
20 

Distance education became the prevalent strategy for higher education institutions 

to expand their services to new and returning students, without the financial implications 

of capital expansion. Higher education utilized the strategy to market to students outside 

their traditional geographic reach by utilizing the power of the Internet. The increasing 

demand from students of all ages for online opportunities provided new ground for the 

expansion of higher education opportunities. 

Grades as an Indicator of Quality of Student Learning 

The grading system in the United States educational system has served as an 

indicator of knowledge for over 100 years. Educators have utilized high school grades as 

a sorting mechanism in American schools to determine postsecondary opportunities. 

Modern society has accepted honors attainment, graduation honors, and course grades as 

an indicator of knowledge acquisition in postsecondary education. Stray (2001) reported 

that the use of grading in schools can be traced to the industrial revolution and the 

development of factories.  

William Farish of Cambridge University developed the first grading system in 

higher education in 1792 (Stray, 2001). Farish mimicked the system established by 

factories of the time: grade A being the best. The thought was that Farish employed the 

grading system in order to teach more students, an aberration at that time when 

instructors rarely had more than a few. The demand for more higher education 

opportunities prompted Farish to open his class to more students, and as such, led to his 

use of a sorting system. This was the first known record of grading utilized in classrooms 

to measure student achievement (Stray, 2001). 


 
21 

Smallwood (1935) reported the first grading in higher education at Yale 

University in 1792. Stiles, President of Yale University, directed the use of the scale in 

the late 18th century. However, Smallwood noted it was not until 1813 that any record of 

grades or marking appeared. 

Using a scale of 100, philosophy and mathematic professors instituted the first use 

of a marking instrument in the 1800s at Harvard. Smallwood noted early systems were 

experimental, utilizing different numerical scales, with no standardized system in place 

between higher education institutions. It was not until the late 1800s that faculty began 

using descriptors, such as A and B, to rank students according to a predetermined 

numerical scale (Smallwood, 1935).  

Experimentation with evaluation of achievement continued into the early 20th 

century, when educational psychologists, including Dewey and Thorndike, attempted to 

compare grading scales with intelligence testing. Thorndikes philosophy of standardized 

testing and grading survived the 20th century, and his quote, Whatever exists at all exists 

in some amount (Thorndike, 1916, as cited in Ebel & Frisbie, p. 26) has been utilized in 

educational measurement textbooks as a validation of the use of standards of 

measurement to measure achievement (Ebel & Frisbie, 1991). 

The use of grades expanded to community colleges, high schools, and elementary 

schools in the early 1900s (Pressey, 1920). The use of grades throughout the educational 

system is fairly standardized today with the 4.0 scale. It is this standardization that allows 

comparison of grades as achievement between educational levels and institutions (Ebel & 

Frisbie, 1991) and allows grades to be utilized as a measure for comparison of 

educational achievement. 


22 

Researchers analyzing the success of community college transfer students have 

traditionally studied the grades of the traditional transfer student with an AA or AS 

degree. Keeley and Houses 1993 study of sophomore and junior transfer students at 

Northern Illinois University analyzed transfer shock (p. 2) for students matriculating 

from community colleges. The researchers found students who transferred from a 

community college obtained a grade point average significantly lower in their first 

semester than did students who began their college career at a 4-year institution. 

However, the results of the longitudinal studies showed that transfer students who 

persisted to graduation showed an equivalent GPA at baccalaureate completion (Keeley 

& House, 1993).  

Students who transferred from occupationally oriented degree programs typically 

were not included in traditional studies of transfer students. While the research in general 

does not include AAS students in traditional transfer data, limited conclusions were 

available comparing AAS students to traditional 4-year college attendees. Townsends 

study at the University of Missouri-Columbia (2002) showed no difference in grades at 

baccalaureate graduation between students with an AA/AS degree and students with an 

AAS degree.  

The use of grades as an indicator of the level of student achievement has been 

relied upon by studies comparing traditional classroom instruction and distance 

instruction. Research analyzing the effectiveness of student learning in distance education 

began with the first correspondence courses offered utilizing the mail service (Russell, 

1999). The study of effectiveness of correspondence courses expanded to include new 

technologies, such as television and video courses, and increased with the proliferation of 


 
23 

online educational offerings. Researchers continued to challenge the effectiveness of 

learning methods not delivered in traditional higher education settings. 

In 1991, Russell reviewed over 355 studies, dating from the 1930s and continuing 

through the late 1980s, and found no significant difference in student learning using any 

form of distance education, as compared with students in classroom-based instruction 

(Russell, 1999). Russells conclusion formed the basis for a series of works collectively 

known as No Significant Difference. Russells conclusion from his studies follows: 

The fact is the findings of comparative studies are absolutely conclusive; one can 

bank on them. No matter how it is produced, how it is delivered, whether or not it 

is interactive, low tech or high tech, students learn equally well with each 

technology and learn as well as their on-campus, face-to-face counterparts even 

though students would rather be on campus with the instructor if that were a real 

choice. (p. xviii) 

Overwhelmingly, studies have supported Russells conclusions, including 

Neuhausers (2002) study of traditional face-to-face education and online education in a 

business communications class at a large urban university in North Carolina. Neuhauser 

concluded there was no significant difference in pre- and post-test scores of students 

enrolled in online and traditional communications classes. In addition, Neuhauser found 

no significant difference in final grades, homework grades, and grades on research 

papers, even though learners in the online course were significantly older than were 

learners in the traditional face-to-face section.  

The Summers et al. (2005) research included a comparison of student 

achievement and satisfaction in an online versus a traditional face-to-face statistics class. 


24 

The study, conducted at the University of Missouri-Columbia, included undergraduate 

nursing students who were tested on both their pre- and post-course knowledge of 

statistics. Their results indicated that utilizing grades as an indicator of knowledge 

showed no significant difference between the online and traditional classroom students. 

In their meta-analysis, Machtmes and Asher (2002) reviewed 30 studies and concluded 

there did not appear to be a difference in achievement, as measured by grades, between 

distance and traditional learners. 

As technology use continued to evolve in online education, various studies were 

conducted to determine whether different delivery methods created a difference in the 

grades of online students compared to their face-to-face counterparts. A study conducted 

by Carmel and Gold (2007) supported Russells original conclusion by analyzing specific 

types of online platforms and delivery models. Carmel and Golds study included hybrid 

and traditional classroom-based instruction. They analyzed results from 164 students in 

110 courses and found no significant difference in student achievement based on grades 

between students enrolled in either delivery method.  

Additional studies supporting Russells theory have crossed multiple content 

areas and delivery models. Brown and Liedholms (2002) study at Michigan State 

University included microeconomics students in virtual, hybrid, and traditional 

classroom-based instruction. The study included 389 students in the traditional setting, 

258 in the hybrid delivery section and 89 students enrolled in online education.  No 

significant difference in student learning as measured by end of course grades was found. 

Research also showed type of course discipline is not affected by the online 

delivery model. Schulman and Simms (1999) compared pretest and posttest scores of 


25 

students enrolled in an online course and a traditional course at Nova Southeastern 

University. The researchers compared 40 undergraduate students enrolled in online 

courses and 59 undergraduate students enrolled in the classroom setting of the same 

course. Results indicated that the students who select online courses scored higher than 

traditional students scored on the pretest results. However, posttest results showed no 

significant difference for the online students versus the in-class students. Schulman and 

Simms concluded that online students were learning equally as well as their classroom-

based counterparts. Reigles (2007) analysis across disciplines at the University of San 

Francisco and the University of California found no significant difference between online 

and face-to-face student grade attainment. 

Shachar and Neumann (2003) conducted a meta-analysis that estimated and 

compared the differences between the academic performance of students enrolled in 

distance education compared to those enrolled in traditional settings over the period from 

1990-2002. Eighty-six studies containing data from over 15,000 participating students 

were included in their analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that in two-thirds 

of the cases, students taking courses by distance education outperformed their student 

counterparts enrolled in traditionally instructed courses.  

Lynch, during the use of the Tegrity system, a brand-specific online platform at 

Louisiana State University, found that students grades were slightly better after utilizing 

the technology than when the traditional approach was used (Lynch, 2002). Initial results 

of a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study of 5000 students over 2 years indicated 

that the U-Pace online students performed 12% better than their traditional Psychology 

101 counterparts on the same cumulative test (Perez, 2009). Arles (2002) study found 


26 

students enrolled in online human anatomy courses at Rio Salado College scored an 

average of 6.3% higher on assessments than the national achievement average. Students 

were assessed using a national standardized test generated by the Human Anatomy and 

Physiology Society, whose norming sample is based entirely on traditional classroom 

delivery (Arle, 2002).  

In a study conducted by Stephenson, Brown, and Griffin (2008), comparing three 

different delivery styles (traditional, asynchronous electronic courseware, and 

synchronous e-lectures), results indicated no increased effectiveness of any delivery style 

when all question types were taken into account. However, when results were analyzed, 

students receiving traditional lectures showed the lowest levels on questions designed to 

assess comprehension.  

Research found supporters in higher education academic leaders. In a 2006 survey 

of Midwestern postsecondary institutions concerning their online offerings, 56 % of 

academic leaders in the 11 states rated the learning outcomes in online education as the 

same or superior to those in face-to-face instructional settings. The proportion of higher 

education institutions believing that online learning outcomes were superior to those for 

face-to-face outcomes was still relatively small, but had grown by 34% since 2003, from 

10.2 to 13.7 % (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). This belief added merit to the conclusions 

supported by Russell and others. 

Russells (1999) no significant difference conclusion had its detractors. The 

most commonly cited is Phipps and Merisotis (1999), who reviewed Russells original 

meta-analysis (1999) and reported a much different conclusion. They concluded that the 

overall quality of the original research was questionable, that much of the research did 


27 

not control for extraneous variables, and therefore it could not show cause and effect. 

They included in their findings evidence that the studies utilized by Russell (2000) in the 

meta-analysis did not use randomly selected subjects, did not take into effect the 

differences among students, and did not include tests of validity and reliability.  

The  Phipps and Merisotis (1999) analysis included the conclusion that research 

has focused too much on individual courses rather than on academic programs, and has 

not taken into account differences among students. They postulated that based on these 

conclusions, there is a significant difference in the learning results, as evidenced by 

grades, of students participating in distance education as compared to their classroom-

based peers. Their analysis of Russells original work questioned both the quality and 

effectiveness of research comparing distance and traditional education delivery.  

While there has been ongoing conjecture that online education students are not 

receiving an equivalent learning experience compared to their traditional classroom 

counterparts, studies utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning have produced 

little evidence of the disparity. The incidence of studies showing significant negative 

differences in grades of online learners is small. Higher education institutions have 

indicated their support for online education, and its continued growth has allowed studies 

such as the present research to contribute to ongoing dialogue. 

Student Retention in Postsecondary Education 

Persistence and retention in higher education is an issue that has intrigued 

researchers for over 50 years. Quantitative studies conducted in the mid-20th century 

produced data that caused researchers to look at low retention rates in higher education 


28 

and search for answers. This question has continued to consume researchers and higher 

education institutions. 

In 1987, Tinto attempted to summarize studies of individual student retention in 

higher education by proposing a theory to allow higher education administrators to 

predict success and support students (Tinto, 1987). Tintos model of student engagement 

has been in use for over 20 years as higher education administrators and faculty attempt 

to explain student retention issues at universities and colleges. Tintos model primarily 

focused on factors of student engagement: How students respond to instructors, the 

higher education community itself, and students own engagement in learning are the 

primary factors Tinto theorized as determining the students retention. In the concluding 

remarks to his 1987 treatise on retention, Tinto acknowledged that persistence in higher 

education is but one facet of human growth and development, and one that cannot 

necessarily be attributed to a single factor or strategy. 

Tintos (1987) original study of student retention included the observation that 

student retention is a complicated web of events that shape student leaving and 

persistence. He observed that the view of student retention had changed since the 1950s, 

when students were thought to leave due to lack of motivation, persistence, and skills, 

hence the name dropout. In the 1970s, research began to focus on the role of the 

environment in student decisions to stay or leave. In the 1990s, Tinto proposed that the 

actions of the faculty were the key to institutional efforts to enhance student retention 

(Tinto, 2007). This was a significant addition to his theory, placing the cause on the 

instructor instead of the student, and it has done much to influence retention strategies 


29 

utilized in higher education institutions (Tinto, 2007). Tintos studies have driven 

research in both traditional retention studies and those involving distance education.  

Studies of the persistence of the postsecondary student routinely focus on 4-year 

postsecondary education. It is only within the last 20 years that persistence studies have 

included community college students and occupational students, acknowledging that their 

reasons for entering the postsecondary community are different from the traditional 4-

year higher education participant (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). With different avenues to a 

baccalaureate degree more prevalent, the research into college persistence has expanded 

to include other types of programs and students. 

Postsecondary student retention rates routinely utilize data from longitudinal 

studies of students entering in a Fall semester and completing a bachelors program no 

more than 6 years later (NCES, 2003). The National Center for Education Statistics 

reported that 55% of those seeking a baccalaureate degree would complete in 6 years 

(NCES, 2003). The report acknowledged institutions are unable to follow students who 

transfer to other institutions; they are able to report only the absence of enrollment in 

their own institution.  

Research has also found a large gap between community college entrants and 4-

year college entrants in rates of attaining a bachelors degree. Dougherty (1992) reported 

that students entering community college receive 11 to 19% fewer bachelors degrees 

than students beginning at a 4-year university. Dougherty postulated that the lower 

baccalaureate attainment rate of community college entrants was attributable to both their 

individual traits and the institution they entered (Dougherty, 1992). 


30 

Studies of student retention of community college also vary based on the types of 

students. Community college retention rates are routinely reported as lower than 

traditional 4-year institutions (NCES, 2007). Cohen and Brawer (1996) attributed the 

differences in retention to the difference in the mission. In many instances, students did 

not enroll in a community college in order to attain a degree (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). 

The most recent longitudinal study in 1993 showed a retention rate of 55.4% of students 

after 3 years (NCES, 2001).  

Of community college students, only 60.9% indicated a desire to transfer later to a 

baccalaureate degree completion program (NCES, 2003). While retention data collected 

by the federal government (NCES, 2003) did not include students with an AAS degree, 

Townsends studies of the transfer rates and baccalaureate attainment rates of students in 

Missouri who had completed an Associate of Arts and students who had completed an 

Associate of Applied Science degree was 61% compared to 54% (Townsend, 2001).  

Vocational or occupational programs have reported retention rates as program 

completion, a definition involving completion of specific tasks and competencies 

instead of grades and tied to a limited program length. This state and federal requirement 

indicates program quality and ensures continued federal funding. In 2001, the U.S. 

Department of Education reported a 60.1% completion rate of postsecondary students 

enrolled in occupational education (NCES, 2007). Until 1995, the reasons for students 

leaving was neither delineated nor reported; it was not until federal reporting 

requirements under the Carl Perkins Act of 1994 that institutions were required to explore 

why students were not retained in vocational programs (P.L. 105-332). 


31 

Distance education provided a new arena for the study of student persistence. 

Theorists and researchers have attempted to utilize Tintos model of student persistence 

to explain retention issues involved with distance education. However, Rovai (2003) 

analyzed the differing student characteristics of distance learners as compared to the 

traditional students targeted by Tintos original models and concluded that student 

retention theories proposed from that population were no longer applicable to distance 

education learners. Rovai proposed that distance educators could address retention in 

ways that traditional higher education has not. He suggested that distance educators 

utilize strategies such as capitalizing on students expectations of technology, addressing 

economic benefits and specific educational needs to increase student retention in courses 

(Rovai, 2003). 

The expanded use of technology created a distinct subset of research into student 

retention issues. In 2004, Berge and Huang developed an overview of models of student 

retention, with special emphasis on models developed to explain the retention rates in 

distance education. Their studies primarily focused on the variables in student 

demographics and external factors, such as age and gender, which influence persistence 

and retention in online learning. Berge and Huang found that traditional models of 

student retention such as Tintos did not acknowledge the differences in student 

expectations and goals that are ingrained in the students selection of the online learning 

option. 

Other researchers have attempted to study retention issues specifically for online 

education. In a meta-analysis, Nora and Snyder (2009) found the majority of studies of 

online education focused on students individual characteristics and individual 


32 

perceptions of technology. Nora and Snyder concluded that researchers attempt to utilize 

traditional models of student engagement to explain student retention issues in distance or 

online learning courses, with little or no success. This supported Berge and Huards 

conclusions. Nora and Snyder (2009) also noted a dearth of quantitative research.  

Few quantitative studies exist that support higher or equal retention in online 

students compared to their classroom-based counterparts. One example is the Carmel and 

Gold (2007) study. They found no significant difference in student retention rates 

between students in distance education courses and their traditional classroom-based 

counterparts. The study utilized data from 164 students, 95 enrolled in classroom-based 

courses and 69 enrolled in a hybrid online format. Participants randomly self-selected and 

were not all enrolled in the same course, introducing variables not attributed in the study.  

The majority of quantitative studies instead concluded there is a higher retention 

rate in traditional classrooms than in distance education. In the Phipps and Merisotis 

(1999) review of Russells original research, which included online education, results 

indicated that research has shown even lower retention rates in online students than in 

students attending classes in the traditional college setting. The high dropout rate among 

distance education students was not addressed in Russells meta-analysis, and Phipps and 

Merisotis found no suitable explanation in the research. They postulated that the 

decreased retention rate documented within distance education studies skews 

achievement data by excluding the dropouts. 

Diaz (2002) found a high drop rate for online students compared to traditional 

classroom-based students in an online health education course at Nova Southeastern. 

Other studies have supported the theory that retention of online students is far below that 


33 

of the traditional campus students. In 2002, Carr, reporting for The Chronicle of Higher 

Education, noted that online courses routinely lose 50 % of students who originally 

enrolled, as compared to a retention rate of 70-75% of traditional face-to-face students. 

Carr reported dropout rates of up to 75% in online courses as a likely indicator of the 

difficultly faced in retaining distance education students who do not routinely meet with 

faculty. The data have not been refuted. 

As community colleges began utilizing distance education, retention rates were 

reported as higher than traditional students (Nash, 1984). However, the California 

Community College System report for Fall 2008 courses showed inconsistent retention 

results for distance education learners, varying by the type of course. Results indicated 

equivalent retention rates for online instruction compared to traditional coursework in the 

majority of courses. Lower retention rates were indicated in online engineering, social 

sciences, and mathematics courses as compared to traditional classroom instructional 

models (California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, 2009). 

Due to the limited number of vocational/technical or occupational courses taught 

in the online mode, there was little data on student retention. In 1997, Hogan studied 

technical course and program completion of students in distance and traditional 

vocational education and found that course completion rates were higher for distance 

education students. However, program completion rates were higher for traditional 

students than for students enrolled in distance education (Hogan, 1997).  

In summary, studies of retention have focused primarily on student characteristics 

while acknowledging that postsecondary retention rates vary according to a variety of 

factors. Research showed mixed results concerning the retention rate of online students, 


34 

though quantitative data leans heavily toward a lower course retention rate in online 

students. Data from 4-year universities have shown lower retention rates for online 

students than for traditional face-to-face students, while community colleges have shown 

inconsistent results. Data from vocational-technical education has been limited, but 

course retention rates are higher for online students, while program retention rates are 

lower. No significant research factor affecting retention has been isolated between 

students in online baccalaureate completion programs and students participating in 

traditional classroom-based settings. 

Summary 

Research studies have been conducted analyzing student retention in higher 

education, transfer and retention of students from community colleges to universities, the 

impact of distance education, and student achievement and retention factors related to 

distance education. However, no comparative research was identified that compared the 

achievement and retention of students participating in an occupationally oriented transfer 

program utilizing both online education and traditional classroom-based instruction. 

Chapter Three addresses the topics of research design, hypotheses, and research 

questions. Additionally, population and sample, data collection, and data analysis are 

discussed.

CHAPTER THREE 

METHODOLOGY 

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a significant difference 

between course grades of students enrolled in online Technology Administration courses 

and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The study also examined if there is a 

significant difference between course retention and program retention of students 

enrolled in online Technology Administration courses and their traditional classroom-

based counterparts. The methodology employed to test the research hypotheses is 

presented in this chapter. The chapter is organized into the following sections: research 

design, hypotheses and research questions, population and sample, data collection, data 

analysis, and summary. 

Research Design 

A quantitative, quasi-experimental research design was selected to study grades, 

course retention, and program retention in students enrolled in the Technology 

Administration program. The design was chosen as a means to determine if significant 

differences occur between online and face-to-face students by examining numerical 

scores from all participants enrolled, and retention rates in both courses and programs in 

the Technology Administration program.  

Hypotheses and Research Questions 

This study focused on three research questions with accompanying hypotheses. 

The research questions and hypotheses guiding the study follow. 


 
 
36 

Research Question 1: Is there is a statistically significant difference between 

students grades in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

H1: There is a statistically significant difference in course grades of students 

participating in online courses and students enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at 

the 0.05 level of significance.  

Research Question 2: Is there a statistically significant difference between course 

retention rate of students in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

H2: There is a statistically significant difference in student course retention 

between students participating in online courses and students enrolled in face-to-face 

courses at the 0.05 level of significance.  

Research Question 3: Is there a statistically significant difference in program 

retention between students who entered the program in online classes and students who 

entered the program in traditional face-to-face classes? 

H3: There is a statistically significant difference in program retention between 

students who begin the Technology Administration program in online courses and 

students who begin in face-to-face courses at the 0.05 level of significance. 

Population and Sample 

The two populations selected were students enrolled in online and face-to-face 

courses. The sample included students enrolled in Technology Administration courses. 

Student enrollment was analyzed for all Technology Administration courses in the 

program sequence to determine the number of samples available in online and face-to-

face classes. The course enrollment data for the sample are outlined in Table E1. The 

subsample of the data utilized for the study is presented in Table 1.

The subsample for hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 included all students enrolled in 

two entry-level courses required for completion of the Technology Administration 

program: TA 300 Evolution and Development of Technology, and TA 310 Society and 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
38 

Technology. The university offered the courses in online and face-to-face formats during 

the period of the study. Two instructors, identified as A and B, were involved with 

teaching the online and face-to-face courses. Two courses were selected that met the 

following criteria: (a) the same faculty member taught both courses, (b) the courses were 

offered over the period of the study consistently in online and face-to-face instruction, 

and (c) the syllabi for simultaneous online and face-to-face sections were identical. 

For hypothesis 3, data included records of all students enrolled in TA 300 

Evolution and Development of Technology for the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 

2005, and 2006. The course was selected for inclusion in the study based on the 

following criteria: (a) student enrollment in the course was the result of declaration of the 

Technology Administration program major and (b) parameters of the study allowed 

students 2 or more years to complete the program requirements. For the purpose of the 

study, all student names were removed. 

Data Collection 

An Institutional Review Board (IRB) form was prepared for Washburn University 

approval prior to data collection. The study was designated as an exempt study. The 

Washburn University IRB form is provided in Appendix A. Approval of the IRB was 

transmitted by e-mail. A copy is located in Appendix B. In addition, an IRB was 

submitted to Baker University. The form is located in Appendix C. The Baker IRB 

approval letter is located in Appendix D. 

Washburn University had two types of data collection systems in place during the 

period identified for the study, Spring 2002 through Spring 2008. The AS 400 data 

collection system generated paper reports for 2002 and 2003. The researcher was allowed 


 
39 

access to paper records for 2002 and 2003. Enrollment results for all technology 

administration sections for 2002-2003 were entered manually into an Excel spreadsheet.  

In 2004, the University transferred to the Banner electronic student data 

management system. All records since 2004 were archived electronically and were 

retrieved utilizing the following filters for data specific to students enrolled in the 

identified Technology Administration courses: TA course designation and specific 

coding for year and semester to be analyzed (01 = Spring semester, 03 = Fall semester, 

200X for specified year). Results retrieved under the Banner system were saved as an 

Excel spreadsheet by the researcher. The course enrollment data for the sample are 

presented in Tables E1 and E2. 

Student transcripts and records were analyzed to determine program completion 

or continued enrollment in the program for program retention analysis. Documents 

examined included paper student advising files located within the Technology 

Administration department and specific student records housed within the Banner 

reporting system. Technology Administration course TA 300 was selected based on the 

following: (a) It is a required entry course only for Technology Administration majors, 

and (b) TA 310 is a dual enrollment course for business department majors. 

Data Analysis 

Data analysis for all hypothesis testing was conducted utilizing SPSS software 

version 16.0. The software system provided automated analysis of the statistical 

measures. 

To address Research Question 1, a two-factor analysis of variance was used to 

analyze for a potential difference in delivery method (online and face-to-face), potential 


40 

difference in instructor (instructors A and B), and potential interaction between the two 

factors. When the analysis of variance reveals a difference between the levels of any 

factor, Salkind (2008) referred to this as the main effect. This analysis produces three F 

statistics: to determine if a difference in grades of online students as compared to their 

classroom based counterparts was affected by a main effect for delivery, a main effect for 

instructor, and for interaction between instructor and delivery. 

Chi-square testing was selected to address research questions 2 and 3. The 

rationale for selecting chi-square testing was to observe whether a specific distribution of 

frequencies is the same as if it were to occur by chance (Salkind, 2008). If the obtained 

chi-square value is greater than the critical value, it indicates there is sufficient evidence 

to believe the research hypothesis is true. For research question 2, a chi-square test for 

differences between proportions analyzed course retention of online and face-to-face 

students at the end of semester. For Research Question 3, a chi-square test for differences 

between proportions analyzed program retention comparing students who began the 

program in the online section of TA 300 to the students who began in the face-to-face 

section.

Header: Limitations of the Study 
Roberts (2004) defined the limitations of the study as those features of the study 

that may affect the results of the study or the ability to generalize the results. The 

limitations of this study included (a) potential for data entry error, (b) curriculum 

modifications not reflected in the syllabi made by instructors over the period of the study, 

(c) behavior of the instructors during delivery in the two different formats, and (d) 


 
41 

rationale of students for selecting one course delivery method over another. These may 

affect the generalizability of this study to other populations. 

Summary 

This chapter described the research design, population and sample, hypotheses, 

data collection, and analysis used in this research study. Statistical analysis using two-

way analysis of variance and chi-square were used to determine if there are significant 

statistical differences in the course grades, course retention, and program retention of 

students enrolled in online classes as compared to their face-to face counterparts. The 

results of this study are presented in Chapter Four.

CHAPTER ONE 

INTRODUCTION 

Historically, postsecondary education in the United States was founded on the 

principles of the European system, requiring the physical presence of professors and 

students in the same location (Knowles, 1994). From 1626, with the founding of Harvard 

University (The Harvard Guide, 2004), to the development of junior colleges and 

vocational schools in the early 1900s (Cohen & Brawer, 1996; Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), 

the higher education system developed to prepare post-high school students for one of 

three separate tiers. The college and university system in the United States developed its 

own set of structures designed to prepare students for baccalaureate and graduate degrees. 

Junior colleges were limited to associate degrees, while vocational education institutions 

offered occupational certificates. In many cases, there was inadequate recognition of the 

postsecondary education offered at junior colleges and vocational education institutions, 

resulting in the inability of students to transfer to 4-year institutions (National Center for 

Education Statistics, 2006).  

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges began to provide academic, 

vocational, and personal development educational offerings for members of the local 

communities. During this same period, junior or community colleges developed a role as 

transfer institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or 

distance, could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & 

Brawer, 1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs involved Associate 

of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Associate of Applied Science 

(AAS) degrees were developed during the 1990s. The AAS degree was granted to those 


2 

who successfully completed the majority of their college program in vocational 

education. The creation of a variety of applied baccalaureate degrees allowed students 

who had previously thought of the AAS degree as a terminal program to complete a 

baccalaureate degree (Kansas Board of Regents, 2002-2003).  

Online education also became a strategy for students to access higher education in 

the 1990s (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). The proliferation of online courses alleviated some 

of the location-bound barriers to higher education, but online education was criticized as 

less rigorous than traditional classroom-based course work by traditional academicians. 

Russell attempted to address this argument with his 1999 meta-analysis of studies dating 

from the 1920s and covering multiple delivery models, including online education. 

Russell concluded there was no statistically significant difference in student achievement 

between courses offered online and those offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

Since the development of correspondence courses in the 1920s, researchers have 

attempted to ascertain if students participating in distance education are being 

shortchanged in their educational goals. No significant difference in grades has been 

found in the majority of studies designed to address this issue. Studies analyzing online 

student retention have shown significantly lower retention for online students.  In the last 

10 years, research studies have expanded to include variations of online education. These 

include strictly online, hybrid courses, Web-assisted classroom settings, and the 

traditional higher education course offered only as face-to-face instruction (Carmel & 

Gold, 2007).  

Online education continues to proliferate at the same time the number of 

secondary students in the United States overall is projected to increase (National Center 


3 

for Education Statistics [NCES], 2006). The projected increase of potential postsecondary 

students and online postsecondary options provides opportunities for increases in online 

education programs and courses. In 2000, NCES reported that over 65% of students in 

higher education were participating in online courses. In a 2007 study, Allen and Seaman 

estimated only 16% of those enrolled in online education courses are undergraduate 

students seeking their first degree, counter to the projected increase in traditional-age 

students. The majority of enrollees in online education are adults updating or advancing 

their credentials, creating an additional educational market for colleges and universities 

seeking to expand enrollment without adding physical space (Allen & Seaman, 2007a). 

For states and localities faced with a contradictory traditional-age enrollment decrease, 

these figures present an untapped market for higher education courses and programs. 

Background 

Researchers attempted to analyze the efficacy of distance education as far back as 

the 1920s when correspondence courses were created to meet the need of students not 

willing to attend a traditional classroom-based higher education setting. A meta-analysis 

of these studies resulted in The No Significant Difference Phenomenon, reported by 

Russell (2001). The results of over 355 studies were compiled, comparing various modes 

of delivery including correspondence, audio, television courses, and the newest wave of 

computer-facilitated instruction. Following analyses of studies completed prior to 2001, 

Russell concluded there was no difference in learning between students enrolled in 

distance education and those completing courses in the traditional setting.  

Studies completed since then have provided mixed results. Summers, Waigand, 

and Whittaker (2005) found there was no difference in GPA and retention between the 


4 

online and traditional classroom. Arle (2002) found higher achievement by online 

students, and Brown and Liedholm (2002) found GPA and student retention better in a 

traditional classroom setting.  

Student retention is an integral part of the student achievement conversation and 

is an issue for all forms of higher education. Degree-seeking students overall retention 

has been reported as less than 56% by NCES (2001). Long considered a problem in 

higher education, attention to the distance education model has shown even lower 

retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college 

setting (Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). Research on different modalities, such as fully 

online and hybrid online courses, has produced mixed results (Carmel & Gold, 2007). No 

significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities 

has been documented.  

Retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined 

students transfering from a community college. Statistics have consistantly shown a 

lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a 4-year 

university than for students who began their post-high school education at a 4-year 

institution (NCES, 2006). Townsends studies of transfer students at the University of 

Missouri-Columbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who 

had completed an AAS degree than for students beginning their education at a 4-year 

institution (Townsend, 2002). 

Occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively 

new to higher education. Transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges 

to 4-year institutions were common by the 1990s. Townsend (2001), in her study 


 
5 

conducted at the University of MissouriColumbia, observed the blurring of the lines 

between non-transferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and 

undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred. The study conducted 

by Townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their 

education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that 

grew after their completion of an occupationally-oriented degree. Laanan proposed that 

the increase in institutions offering AAS degrees necessitated new ways to transfer 

undergraduate credits (2003).  

The setting of this study is a medium-sized Midwestern campus located in 

Topeka, Kansas. Washburn University enrolls approximately 6000 students a year in 

undergraduate and graduate programs, including liberal arts, professional schools, and a 

law school (Washburn University, 2008). The Technology Administration (TA) program 

selected for the present study began in the 1990s as a baccalaureate degree completion 

program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a 

Kansas community college or through Washburns articulation agreement with Kansas 

vocational-technical schools. This program provided students who previously had 

obtained an Associate of Applied Science degree in an occupational area an opportunity 

to earn a bachelors degree. 

Peterson, Dean of Continuing Education, Washburn University, stated that in 

early 1999, Washburn University began online courses and programs at the behest of a 

neighboring community college (personal communication, April 18, 2008). Washburn 

was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students 

graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an Associate of Applied 


6 

Science degree. The TA program was among the first programs to offer the online 

bachelors degree completion option. The TA program offered its first online courses in 

Spring 2000.  

Online education at Washburn expanded to other programs and courses, to 

include over 200 courses (Washburn University, 2008). The original online partnership 

with two community colleges expanded to include 16 additional community colleges and 

four technical colleges in Kansas, as well as colleges in Missouri, California, Wisconsin, 

South Carolina, and Nebraska (Washburn University, 2008). 

An initial study in 2002 of students course grades and retention in online courses 

offered at Washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face course work (Peterson,  personal 

communication, April 18, 2008). No studies of program retention have been completed.  

In 2008, Atkins reported overall enrollment at Washburn University decreased 

6.7% from Fall 2004 to Fall 2008, from 7400 to 6901 students. During the same period, 

online course enrollment patterns increased 65%, from 3550 students to 5874 in 2007-

2008 (Washburn University, 2008). Atkins also reported that between 1998 and 2008, the 

ratio of traditional post-high school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at 

Washburn University reversed from 40:60 to 60:40. The shift in enrollment patterns 

produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the 21st century; however, 

Washburn University anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in Kansas through 

2016, based on demographic patterns of the state. The state figures are opposite the 

anticipated increase of traditional-age students nationally (NCES, 2008). The increase in 


distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditional-age 

students provided the focus for the study.

Purpose of the Study 

Online education has become an important strategy for the higher education 

institution that was the setting of this study. First, the purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students 

participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The 

second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference 

between course retention of students participating in TA online courses and their 

traditional classroom-based counterparts. The second part of the study was a replication 

of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroom-based 

instruction (Carmel & Gold, 2007; Russell, 1999). A third purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who 

began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in 

traditional face-to-face courses. The studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base 

concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree 

completion opportunities. 

Research Questions 

Roberts (2004) stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the 

structure for presenting the results of the research. The research questions guiding this 

study were: 


 
8 

1. 

Is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in 

online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

2. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates 

in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

3. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for 

students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students 

entering the program enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes? 

Overview of the Methodology 

A quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course, course retention, 

and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-face TA 

program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at Washburn 

University were utilized from comparative online and traditional face-to-face classes in 

two separate courses. In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of 885 students 

enrolled in online and traditional face-to-face courses was identified. The sample 

included students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 

and 2006 in both the online and traditional face-to-face classes. Two instructors were 

responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-to-face classes for the 

period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential 

difference in the dependent variables, course grades due to delivery method (online and 

face-to-face), instructor (instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the 

two independent variables (Research Question 1). A chi-square test for differences 

among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention (Research 

Questions 2 and 3).

CHAPTER TWO 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

This chapter presents the background for research into the efficacy of distance 

education in the delivery of higher education. Research studies have focused primarily on 

grades as a measure of the quality of distance education courses as compared to 

traditional face-to-face instruction. Utilizing grades has produced a dividing line among 

education researchers concerning the use of distance education as a delivery model. 

Retention in distance education has focused primarily on single courses, with little 

program retention data available. Data from retention studies in higher education have 

focused primarily on the traditional 4-year university student. Retention studies of 

community college students have produced quantitative results; however, these studies 

have been directed at community college students who identify themselves as transfer 

students early in their community college careers. Retention studies of students enrolled 

in occupationally oriented programs are limited. 

Statistical data of higher education shows an increased use of distance education 

for traditional academic courses as well as occupationally oriented courses. The increase 

in distance education courses and programs has provided a new dimension to studies of 

both grades and retention. The recognition of this increase, as well as questions 

concerning its impact on student learning and retention, produced the impetus for this 

study. 

The following review of the literature represents the literature related to this 

research study. Through examination of previous research, the direction of the present 

study was formulated. Specifically, the chapter is organized into four sections: (a) the 


13 

history of occupational transfer programs; (b) the history and research of distance 

education, including occupational transfer programs utilizing distance education; (c) 

research utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning in online education; and (d) 

research focusing on student retention in higher education, including student retention 

issues in transfer education and online transfer courses and programs. 

History of Occupational Transfer Programs 

The measure of success in higher education has been characterized as the 

attainment of a bachelors degree at a 4-year university. Occupationally oriented 

education was considered primarily a function of job preparation, and until the 1990s was 

not considered transferrable to other higher education institutions. Occupational transfer 

programs are a recent occurrence within the postsecondary system that provides an 

additional pathway to bachelors degree completion.  

Historically, the postsecondary experience in the United States developed as a 

three-track system. Colleges were established in the United States in 1636 with the 

founding of Harvard College (The Harvard Guide, 2004). Junior colleges were first 

founded in 1901 as experimental post-high school graduate programs (Joliet Junior 

College History, 2008). Their role was initially as a transfer institution to the university. 

When the Smith-Hughes Act was passed in 1917, a system of vocational education was 

born in the United States (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), and was designed to provide further 

education to those students not viewed as capable of success in a university setting. 

Vocational education, currently referred to as occupational or technical education, 

was not originally designed to be a path to higher education. The first programs were 

designed to help agricultural workers complete their education and increase their skills. 


14 

More vocational programs were developed during the early 20th century as 

industrialization developed and as increasing numbers of skills were needed by workers 

in blue-collar occupations (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003). 

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges expanded their programs beyond 

academic selections to provide occupational development and continuing education. 

Because of the geographic area from which they attracted students, junior colleges 

developed a role as community colleges. They also solidified their role as transfer 

institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or distance, 

could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & Brawer, 

1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs to 4-year universities 

involved traditional academic degrees, including the Associate of Arts (AA) and 

Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Occupational programs and continuing education 

were viewed as terminal and non-transferrable. 

In 1984, Congress authorized the Carl Perkins Vocational and Technical 

Education Act (P.L. 98-524). In the legislation, Congress responded to employers 

concerns about the lack of basic skills in employees by adding academic requirements to 

vocational education legislation. Vocational program curriculum was expanded to include 

language arts, mathematics, and science principles, and the curriculum reflected the 

context of the program. The Secretarys Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills 

(SCANS) was created in 1990 to determine the skills young people need to succeed in the 

world of work (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). In the second Carl Perkins 

reauthorization in 1990 (P.L. 105-332), Congress responded to the report, which targeted 

academic and job skills, by outlining a seamless system of vocational and academic 


15 

education to prepare vocational students to progress into and through higher education. 

This emphasis led to the development of Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees 

during the 1990s. Granted to those who have successfully completed programs in the 

applied arts and sciences for careers, AAS degrees were seen as terminal (Kansas Board 

of Regents, 2002-2003). 

But as one goal was attained, conversation turned to creating a pathway from 

occupational associate degrees to bachelors degree completion. The desire of students to 

continue from technical degrees to a baccalaureate was not a new idea. In a paper 

presented in 1989 to the American Technical Association national conference, Troutt-

Ervin and Morgans overview of 2+2 programs showed acceptance of AAS degrees at 

traditional universities was generally non-existent. Their suggestion for an academic 

bridge from early technical education to baccalaureate programs highlighted programs 

accepting AAS degrees toward baccalaureate completion were an exception rather than a 

rule (Troutt-Ervin & Morgan, 1989). It was not until the late 1990s that applied 

baccalaureate degrees recognized credits from technical degree students who had 

previously thought of themselves in a terminal program to complete their baccalaureate 

degree (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the advance of recognition of AAS degrees, standard definitions of 

transfer students continued to exclude students who completed technical programs. The 

U.S. Department of Education did not include students receiving an Associate of Applied 

Science degree in the definition of students preparing for transfer to 4-year colleges 

(Bradburn, Hurst, & Peng, 2001; Carnevale, 2006). Most states had comparable policies 

in place concerning core academic curriculum, articulation agreements, transfer of credit, 


16 

and statewide transfer guides. There was no general recognition of occupational credit 

transfer. Only a few states, including Kansas, Missouri, and Washington, allowed credits 

earned in occupationally oriented degrees to transfer to 4-year institutions (Townsend, 

2001). No state had set clear goals for the transference of occupational credits between 

institutions or for the state as a whole (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the lack of recognition of occupational transfer credit at the federal level, 

a new definition of transfer education had emerged. Initially defined as the general 

education component of the first 2 years of a baccalaureate, the definition of transfer 

education now included any courses that transferred to a 4-year college, regardless of the 

nature of the courses (Townsend, 2001).  

The line between vocational schools, community colleges, and 4-year institutions 

blurred in the United States as employers and students increasingly made business 

decisions regarding education and workforce development. Employers increasingly asked 

for employees with academic and technical skills, as well as critical thinking skills and 

personal responsibility (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). Returning students themselves 

were more attuned to the demands of the 21st century workforce. Their desire to return to 

higher education, coupled with the economy and the variety of options available to them, 

required a more adaptive higher education system (Carnevale, 2006). There was growing 

demand among new and returning students for higher education opportunities responsive 

to their needs. The expanding needs of the returning student provided opportunities for 

higher education to respond by utilizing different delivery models. 


 
 
17 

Distance Education 

Online education became a strategy for postsecondary institutions when the first 

correspondence courses were initiated with the mail service in the early 20th century 

(Russell, 1999). As various technologies emerged, distance education utilized television 

and video models, in addition to paper-based correspondence courses. The expansion of 

distance education utilizing computer technologies renewed academic debate over the 

efficacy of the delivery model. 

Online education utilizing the Internet became a significant factor in the 1990s, 

prompting renewed evaluation of the use of distance learning opportunities (Russell, 

1999, Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). In 19992000, the number of students who took any 

distance education courses was 8.4% of total undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary 

education (NCES, 2000). In 2000, the report of the Web-Based Education Commission to 

the President and Congress concluded that the Internet was no longer in question as a tool 

to transform the way teaching and learning was offered. The Commission recommended 

that the nation embrace E-learning as a strategy to provide on-demand, high-quality 

teaching and professional development to keep the United States competitive in the 

global workforce. They also recommended continued funding of research into teaching 

and learning utilizing web-based resources (Web-Based Education Commission, 2000). 

The acceptance of the importance of the Internet for delivery of higher education opened 

new opportunities for research and continued the academic debate of the quality of 

instruction delivered in online education courses and programs. 

In a longitudinal study from 2002-2007, The Sloan Consortium, a group of higher 

education institutions actively involved in online education, began studies of online 


18 

education in the United States over a period of 5 years. In the first study, researchers 

Allen and Seaman (2003) conducted polls of postsecondary institutions involved with 

online education and found that students overwhelming responded to the availability of 

online education, with over 1.6 million students taking at least one online course during 

the Fall semester of 2002. Over one third of these students took all of their courses 

online. The survey also found that in 2002, 81% of all institutions of higher education 

offered at least one fully online or blended course (Allen & Seaman, 2003). 

In their intermediate report in 2005, Allen and Seaman postulated that online 

education had continued to make inroads in postsecondary education, with 65% of 

schools offering graduate courses and programs face-to-face also offering graduate 

courses online. Sixty-three percent of undergraduate institutions offering face-to-face 

courses also offered courses online. From 2003 to 2005, the survey results showed that 

online education, as a long-term strategy for institutions, had increased from 49% to 56%. 

In addition, core education online course offerings had increased (Allen & Seaman, 

2005). 

In Allen and Seamans final report (2007b) for the Sloan Consortium, the 

researchers reported that almost 3.5 million students participated in at least one online 

course during the Fall 2006 term, a nearly 10% increase over the number reported in the 

previous year. Allen and Seaman also reported a 9.7% increase in online enrollment, 

compared to the 1.5% growth in overall higher education. They found by 2007, 2-year 

institutions had the highest growth rates and accounted for over the half the online 

enrollments in the previous 5 years. The researchers concluded, based on a survey 


 
 
19 

conducted as part of the research, institutions believed that improved student access was 

the top reason for offering online courses and programs (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). 

Community colleges began embracing distance education in the 1920s as part of 

their mission to provide low-cost, time-effective education. Community colleges initially 

provided correspondence courses by mail, but later switched to television and video 

courses as technology improved (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). In 2001, over 90% of public 2-

year colleges in the United States provided distance education courses over the Internet 

(NCES, 2001).  

Vocational education, by the nature of its instructional format, was among the last 

of the educational institutions to participate in distance education. Because of the 

kinesthetic nature of instruction, vocational education leaders began investigating 

distance education opportunities in the 1990s, relying on the method to provide only the 

lecture portion of instruction. By 2004, only 31% of students enrolled in vocational 

schools had participated in some form of distance education during their program of 

study (NCES, 2005). In 2008, hands-on instruction in programs such as automobile 

mechanics and welding, and the clinical portion of health occupations programs, 

continued to be taught in the traditional classroom setting (NCES, 2008). 

Analysis of data reported by the NCES indicated that distance education had 

become a staple for higher education institutions. At both the 4-year and 2-year university 

level, over 65% of institutions offered more than 12 million courses in 2006-2007 by 

distance education. While vocational education had traditionally been more hands-on, 

distance education had become more prevalent in providing opportunities for students to 

participate in components of the system over the Internet (NCES, 2008).  


 
 
 
20 

Distance education became the prevalent strategy for higher education institutions 

to expand their services to new and returning students, without the financial implications 

of capital expansion. Higher education utilized the strategy to market to students outside 

their traditional geographic reach by utilizing the power of the Internet. The increasing 

demand from students of all ages for online opportunities provided new ground for the 

expansion of higher education opportunities. 

Grades as an Indicator of Quality of Student Learning 

The grading system in the United States educational system has served as an 

indicator of knowledge for over 100 years. Educators have utilized high school grades as 

a sorting mechanism in American schools to determine postsecondary opportunities. 

Modern society has accepted honors attainment, graduation honors, and course grades as 

an indicator of knowledge acquisition in postsecondary education. Stray (2001) reported 

that the use of grading in schools can be traced to the industrial revolution and the 

development of factories.  

William Farish of Cambridge University developed the first grading system in 

higher education in 1792 (Stray, 2001). Farish mimicked the system established by 

factories of the time: grade A being the best. The thought was that Farish employed the 

grading system in order to teach more students, an aberration at that time when 

instructors rarely had more than a few. The demand for more higher education 

opportunities prompted Farish to open his class to more students, and as such, led to his 

use of a sorting system. This was the first known record of grading utilized in classrooms 

to measure student achievement (Stray, 2001). 


 
21 

Smallwood (1935) reported the first grading in higher education at Yale 

University in 1792. Stiles, President of Yale University, directed the use of the scale in 

the late 18th century. However, Smallwood noted it was not until 1813 that any record of 

grades or marking appeared. 

Using a scale of 100, philosophy and mathematic professors instituted the first use 

of a marking instrument in the 1800s at Harvard. Smallwood noted early systems were 

experimental, utilizing different numerical scales, with no standardized system in place 

between higher education institutions. It was not until the late 1800s that faculty began 

using descriptors, such as A and B, to rank students according to a predetermined 

numerical scale (Smallwood, 1935).  

Experimentation with evaluation of achievement continued into the early 20th 

century, when educational psychologists, including Dewey and Thorndike, attempted to 

compare grading scales with intelligence testing. Thorndikes philosophy of standardized 

testing and grading survived the 20th century, and his quote, Whatever exists at all exists 

in some amount (Thorndike, 1916, as cited in Ebel & Frisbie, p. 26) has been utilized in 

educational measurement textbooks as a validation of the use of standards of 

measurement to measure achievement (Ebel & Frisbie, 1991). 

The use of grades expanded to community colleges, high schools, and elementary 

schools in the early 1900s (Pressey, 1920). The use of grades throughout the educational 

system is fairly standardized today with the 4.0 scale. It is this standardization that allows 

comparison of grades as achievement between educational levels and institutions (Ebel & 

Frisbie, 1991) and allows grades to be utilized as a measure for comparison of 

educational achievement. 


22 

Researchers analyzing the success of community college transfer students have 

traditionally studied the grades of the traditional transfer student with an AA or AS 

degree. Keeley and Houses 1993 study of sophomore and junior transfer students at 

Northern Illinois University analyzed transfer shock (p. 2) for students matriculating 

from community colleges. The researchers found students who transferred from a 

community college obtained a grade point average significantly lower in their first 

semester than did students who began their college career at a 4-year institution. 

However, the results of the longitudinal studies showed that transfer students who 

persisted to graduation showed an equivalent GPA at baccalaureate completion (Keeley 

& House, 1993).  

Students who transferred from occupationally oriented degree programs typically 

were not included in traditional studies of transfer students. While the research in general 

does not include AAS students in traditional transfer data, limited conclusions were 

available comparing AAS students to traditional 4-year college attendees. Townsends 

study at the University of Missouri-Columbia (2002) showed no difference in grades at 

baccalaureate graduation between students with an AA/AS degree and students with an 

AAS degree.  

The use of grades as an indicator of the level of student achievement has been 

relied upon by studies comparing traditional classroom instruction and distance 

instruction. Research analyzing the effectiveness of student learning in distance education 

began with the first correspondence courses offered utilizing the mail service (Russell, 

1999). The study of effectiveness of correspondence courses expanded to include new 

technologies, such as television and video courses, and increased with the proliferation of 


 
23 

online educational offerings. Researchers continued to challenge the effectiveness of 

learning methods not delivered in traditional higher education settings. 

In 1991, Russell reviewed over 355 studies, dating from the 1930s and continuing 

through the late 1980s, and found no significant difference in student learning using any 

form of distance education, as compared with students in classroom-based instruction 

(Russell, 1999). Russells conclusion formed the basis for a series of works collectively 

known as No Significant Difference. Russells conclusion from his studies follows: 

The fact is the findings of comparative studies are absolutely conclusive; one can 

bank on them. No matter how it is produced, how it is delivered, whether or not it 

is interactive, low tech or high tech, students learn equally well with each 

technology and learn as well as their on-campus, face-to-face counterparts even 

though students would rather be on campus with the instructor if that were a real 

choice. (p. xviii) 

Overwhelmingly, studies have supported Russells conclusions, including 

Neuhausers (2002) study of traditional face-to-face education and online education in a 

business communications class at a large urban university in North Carolina. Neuhauser 

concluded there was no significant difference in pre- and post-test scores of students 

enrolled in online and traditional communications classes. In addition, Neuhauser found 

no significant difference in final grades, homework grades, and grades on research 

papers, even though learners in the online course were significantly older than were 

learners in the traditional face-to-face section.  

The Summers et al. (2005) research included a comparison of student 

achievement and satisfaction in an online versus a traditional face-to-face statistics class. 


24 

The study, conducted at the University of Missouri-Columbia, included undergraduate 

nursing students who were tested on both their pre- and post-course knowledge of 

statistics. Their results indicated that utilizing grades as an indicator of knowledge 

showed no significant difference between the online and traditional classroom students. 

In their meta-analysis, Machtmes and Asher (2002) reviewed 30 studies and concluded 

there did not appear to be a difference in achievement, as measured by grades, between 

distance and traditional learners. 

As technology use continued to evolve in online education, various studies were 

conducted to determine whether different delivery methods created a difference in the 

grades of online students compared to their face-to-face counterparts. A study conducted 

by Carmel and Gold (2007) supported Russells original conclusion by analyzing specific 

types of online platforms and delivery models. Carmel and Golds study included hybrid 

and traditional classroom-based instruction. They analyzed results from 164 students in 

110 courses and found no significant difference in student achievement based on grades 

between students enrolled in either delivery method.  

Additional studies supporting Russells theory have crossed multiple content 

areas and delivery models. Brown and Liedholms (2002) study at Michigan State 

University included microeconomics students in virtual, hybrid, and traditional 

classroom-based instruction. The study included 389 students in the traditional setting, 

258 in the hybrid delivery section and 89 students enrolled in online education.  No 

significant difference in student learning as measured by end of course grades was found. 

Research also showed type of course discipline is not affected by the online 

delivery model. Schulman and Simms (1999) compared pretest and posttest scores of 


25 

students enrolled in an online course and a traditional course at Nova Southeastern 

University. The researchers compared 40 undergraduate students enrolled in online 

courses and 59 undergraduate students enrolled in the classroom setting of the same 

course. Results indicated that the students who select online courses scored higher than 

traditional students scored on the pretest results. However, posttest results showed no 

significant difference for the online students versus the in-class students. Schulman and 

Simms concluded that online students were learning equally as well as their classroom-

based counterparts. Reigles (2007) analysis across disciplines at the University of San 

Francisco and the University of California found no significant difference between online 

and face-to-face student grade attainment. 

Shachar and Neumann (2003) conducted a meta-analysis that estimated and 

compared the differences between the academic performance of students enrolled in 

distance education compared to those enrolled in traditional settings over the period from 

1990-2002. Eighty-six studies containing data from over 15,000 participating students 

were included in their analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that in two-thirds 

of the cases, students taking courses by distance education outperformed their student 

counterparts enrolled in traditionally instructed courses.  

Lynch, during the use of the Tegrity system, a brand-specific online platform at 

Louisiana State University, found that students grades were slightly better after utilizing 

the technology than when the traditional approach was used (Lynch, 2002). Initial results 

of a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study of 5000 students over 2 years indicated 

that the U-Pace online students performed 12% better than their traditional Psychology 

101 counterparts on the same cumulative test (Perez, 2009). Arles (2002) study found 


26 

students enrolled in online human anatomy courses at Rio Salado College scored an 

average of 6.3% higher on assessments than the national achievement average. Students 

were assessed using a national standardized test generated by the Human Anatomy and 

Physiology Society, whose norming sample is based entirely on traditional classroom 

delivery (Arle, 2002).  

In a study conducted by Stephenson, Brown, and Griffin (2008), comparing three 

different delivery styles (traditional, asynchronous electronic courseware, and 

synchronous e-lectures), results indicated no increased effectiveness of any delivery style 

when all question types were taken into account. However, when results were analyzed, 

students receiving traditional lectures showed the lowest levels on questions designed to 

assess comprehension.  

Research found supporters in higher education academic leaders. In a 2006 survey 

of Midwestern postsecondary institutions concerning their online offerings, 56 % of 

academic leaders in the 11 states rated the learning outcomes in online education as the 

same or superior to those in face-to-face instructional settings. The proportion of higher 

education institutions believing that online learning outcomes were superior to those for 

face-to-face outcomes was still relatively small, but had grown by 34% since 2003, from 

10.2 to 13.7 % (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). This belief added merit to the conclusions 

supported by Russell and others. 

Russells (1999) no significant difference conclusion had its detractors. The 

most commonly cited is Phipps and Merisotis (1999), who reviewed Russells original 

meta-analysis (1999) and reported a much different conclusion. They concluded that the 

overall quality of the original research was questionable, that much of the research did 


27 

not control for extraneous variables, and therefore it could not show cause and effect. 

They included in their findings evidence that the studies utilized by Russell (2000) in the 

meta-analysis did not use randomly selected subjects, did not take into effect the 

differences among students, and did not include tests of validity and reliability.  

The  Phipps and Merisotis (1999) analysis included the conclusion that research 

has focused too much on individual courses rather than on academic programs, and has 

not taken into account differences among students. They postulated that based on these 

conclusions, there is a significant difference in the learning results, as evidenced by 

grades, of students participating in distance education as compared to their classroom-

based peers. Their analysis of Russells original work questioned both the quality and 

effectiveness of research comparing distance and traditional education delivery.  

While there has been ongoing conjecture that online education students are not 

receiving an equivalent learning experience compared to their traditional classroom 

counterparts, studies utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning have produced 

little evidence of the disparity. The incidence of studies showing significant negative 

differences in grades of online learners is small. Higher education institutions have 

indicated their support for online education, and its continued growth has allowed studies 

such as the present research to contribute to ongoing dialogue. 

Student Retention in Postsecondary Education 

Persistence and retention in higher education is an issue that has intrigued 

researchers for over 50 years. Quantitative studies conducted in the mid-20th century 

produced data that caused researchers to look at low retention rates in higher education 


28 

and search for answers. This question has continued to consume researchers and higher 

education institutions. 

In 1987, Tinto attempted to summarize studies of individual student retention in 

higher education by proposing a theory to allow higher education administrators to 

predict success and support students (Tinto, 1987). Tintos model of student engagement 

has been in use for over 20 years as higher education administrators and faculty attempt 

to explain student retention issues at universities and colleges. Tintos model primarily 

focused on factors of student engagement: How students respond to instructors, the 

higher education community itself, and students own engagement in learning are the 

primary factors Tinto theorized as determining the students retention. In the concluding 

remarks to his 1987 treatise on retention, Tinto acknowledged that persistence in higher 

education is but one facet of human growth and development, and one that cannot 

necessarily be attributed to a single factor or strategy. 

Tintos (1987) original study of student retention included the observation that 

student retention is a complicated web of events that shape student leaving and 

persistence. He observed that the view of student retention had changed since the 1950s, 

when students were thought to leave due to lack of motivation, persistence, and skills, 

hence the name dropout. In the 1970s, research began to focus on the role of the 

environment in student decisions to stay or leave. In the 1990s, Tinto proposed that the 

actions of the faculty were the key to institutional efforts to enhance student retention 

(Tinto, 2007). This was a significant addition to his theory, placing the cause on the 

instructor instead of the student, and it has done much to influence retention strategies 


29 

utilized in higher education institutions (Tinto, 2007). Tintos studies have driven 

research in both traditional retention studies and those involving distance education.  

Studies of the persistence of the postsecondary student routinely focus on 4-year 

postsecondary education. It is only within the last 20 years that persistence studies have 

included community college students and occupational students, acknowledging that their 

reasons for entering the postsecondary community are different from the traditional 4-

year higher education participant (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). With different avenues to a 

baccalaureate degree more prevalent, the research into college persistence has expanded 

to include other types of programs and students. 

Postsecondary student retention rates routinely utilize data from longitudinal 

studies of students entering in a Fall semester and completing a bachelors program no 

more than 6 years later (NCES, 2003). The National Center for Education Statistics 

reported that 55% of those seeking a baccalaureate degree would complete in 6 years 

(NCES, 2003). The report acknowledged institutions are unable to follow students who 

transfer to other institutions; they are able to report only the absence of enrollment in 

their own institution.  

Research has also found a large gap between community college entrants and 4-

year college entrants in rates of attaining a bachelors degree. Dougherty (1992) reported 

that students entering community college receive 11 to 19% fewer bachelors degrees 

than students beginning at a 4-year university. Dougherty postulated that the lower 

baccalaureate attainment rate of community college entrants was attributable to both their 

individual traits and the institution they entered (Dougherty, 1992). 


30 

Studies of student retention of community college also vary based on the types of 

students. Community college retention rates are routinely reported as lower than 

traditional 4-year institutions (NCES, 2007). Cohen and Brawer (1996) attributed the 

differences in retention to the difference in the mission. In many instances, students did 

not enroll in a community college in order to attain a degree (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). 

The most recent longitudinal study in 1993 showed a retention rate of 55.4% of students 

after 3 years (NCES, 2001).  

Of community college students, only 60.9% indicated a desire to transfer later to a 

baccalaureate degree completion program (NCES, 2003). While retention data collected 

by the federal government (NCES, 2003) did not include students with an AAS degree, 

Townsends studies of the transfer rates and baccalaureate attainment rates of students in 

Missouri who had completed an Associate of Arts and students who had completed an 

Associate of Applied Science degree was 61% compared to 54% (Townsend, 2001).  

Vocational or occupational programs have reported retention rates as program 

completion, a definition involving completion of specific tasks and competencies 

instead of grades and tied to a limited program length. This state and federal requirement 

indicates program quality and ensures continued federal funding. In 2001, the U.S. 

Department of Education reported a 60.1% completion rate of postsecondary students 

enrolled in occupational education (NCES, 2007). Until 1995, the reasons for students 

leaving was neither delineated nor reported; it was not until federal reporting 

requirements under the Carl Perkins Act of 1994 that institutions were required to explore 

why students were not retained in vocational programs (P.L. 105-332). 


31 

Distance education provided a new arena for the study of student persistence. 

Theorists and researchers have attempted to utilize Tintos model of student persistence 

to explain retention issues involved with distance education. However, Rovai (2003) 

analyzed the differing student characteristics of distance learners as compared to the 

traditional students targeted by Tintos original models and concluded that student 

retention theories proposed from that population were no longer applicable to distance 

education learners. Rovai proposed that distance educators could address retention in 

ways that traditional higher education has not. He suggested that distance educators 

utilize strategies such as capitalizing on students expectations of technology, addressing 

economic benefits and specific educational needs to increase student retention in courses 

(Rovai, 2003). 

The expanded use of technology created a distinct subset of research into student 

retention issues. In 2004, Berge and Huang developed an overview of models of student 

retention, with special emphasis on models developed to explain the retention rates in 

distance education. Their studies primarily focused on the variables in student 

demographics and external factors, such as age and gender, which influence persistence 

and retention in online learning. Berge and Huang found that traditional models of 

student retention such as Tintos did not acknowledge the differences in student 

expectations and goals that are ingrained in the students selection of the online learning 

option. 

Other researchers have attempted to study retention issues specifically for online 

education. In a meta-analysis, Nora and Snyder (2009) found the majority of studies of 

online education focused on students individual characteristics and individual 


32 

perceptions of technology. Nora and Snyder concluded that researchers attempt to utilize 

traditional models of student engagement to explain student retention issues in distance or 

online learning courses, with little or no success. This supported Berge and Huards 

conclusions. Nora and Snyder (2009) also noted a dearth of quantitative research.  

Few quantitative studies exist that support higher or equal retention in online 

students compared to their classroom-based counterparts. One example is the Carmel and 

Gold (2007) study. They found no significant difference in student retention rates 

between students in distance education courses and their traditional classroom-based 

counterparts. The study utilized data from 164 students, 95 enrolled in classroom-based 

courses and 69 enrolled in a hybrid online format. Participants randomly self-selected and 

were not all enrolled in the same course, introducing variables not attributed in the study.  

The majority of quantitative studies instead concluded there is a higher retention 

rate in traditional classrooms than in distance education. In the Phipps and Merisotis 

(1999) review of Russells original research, which included online education, results 

indicated that research has shown even lower retention rates in online students than in 

students attending classes in the traditional college setting. The high dropout rate among 

distance education students was not addressed in Russells meta-analysis, and Phipps and 

Merisotis found no suitable explanation in the research. They postulated that the 

decreased retention rate documented within distance education studies skews 

achievement data by excluding the dropouts. 

Diaz (2002) found a high drop rate for online students compared to traditional 

classroom-based students in an online health education course at Nova Southeastern. 

Other studies have supported the theory that retention of online students is far below that 


33 

of the traditional campus students. In 2002, Carr, reporting for The Chronicle of Higher 

Education, noted that online courses routinely lose 50 % of students who originally 

enrolled, as compared to a retention rate of 70-75% of traditional face-to-face students. 

Carr reported dropout rates of up to 75% in online courses as a likely indicator of the 

difficultly faced in retaining distance education students who do not routinely meet with 

faculty. The data have not been refuted. 

As community colleges began utilizing distance education, retention rates were 

reported as higher than traditional students (Nash, 1984). However, the California 

Community College System report for Fall 2008 courses showed inconsistent retention 

results for distance education learners, varying by the type of course. Results indicated 

equivalent retention rates for online instruction compared to traditional coursework in the 

majority of courses. Lower retention rates were indicated in online engineering, social 

sciences, and mathematics courses as compared to traditional classroom instructional 

models (California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, 2009). 

Due to the limited number of vocational/technical or occupational courses taught 

in the online mode, there was little data on student retention. In 1997, Hogan studied 

technical course and program completion of students in distance and traditional 

vocational education and found that course completion rates were higher for distance 

education students. However, program completion rates were higher for traditional 

students than for students enrolled in distance education (Hogan, 1997).  

In summary, studies of retention have focused primarily on student characteristics 

while acknowledging that postsecondary retention rates vary according to a variety of 

factors. Research showed mixed results concerning the retention rate of online students, 


34 

though quantitative data leans heavily toward a lower course retention rate in online 

students. Data from 4-year universities have shown lower retention rates for online 

students than for traditional face-to-face students, while community colleges have shown 

inconsistent results. Data from vocational-technical education has been limited, but 

course retention rates are higher for online students, while program retention rates are 

lower. No significant research factor affecting retention has been isolated between 

students in online baccalaureate completion programs and students participating in 

traditional classroom-based settings. 

Summary 

Research studies have been conducted analyzing student retention in higher 

education, transfer and retention of students from community colleges to universities, the 

impact of distance education, and student achievement and retention factors related to 

distance education. However, no comparative research was identified that compared the 

achievement and retention of students participating in an occupationally oriented transfer 

program utilizing both online education and traditional classroom-based instruction. 

Chapter Three addresses the topics of research design, hypotheses, and research 

questions. Additionally, population and sample, data collection, and data analysis are 

discussed.

CHAPTER THREE 

METHODOLOGY 

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a significant difference 

between course grades of students enrolled in online Technology Administration courses 

and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The study also examined if there is a 

significant difference between course retention and program retention of students 

enrolled in online Technology Administration courses and their traditional classroom-

based counterparts. The methodology employed to test the research hypotheses is 

presented in this chapter. The chapter is organized into the following sections: research 

design, hypotheses and research questions, population and sample, data collection, data 

analysis, and summary. 

Research Design 

A quantitative, quasi-experimental research design was selected to study grades, 

course retention, and program retention in students enrolled in the Technology 

Administration program. The design was chosen as a means to determine if significant 

differences occur between online and face-to-face students by examining numerical 

scores from all participants enrolled, and retention rates in both courses and programs in 

the Technology Administration program.  

Hypotheses and Research Questions 

This study focused on three research questions with accompanying hypotheses. 

The research questions and hypotheses guiding the study follow. 


 
 
36 

Research Question 1: Is there is a statistically significant difference between 

students grades in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

H1: There is a statistically significant difference in course grades of students 

participating in online courses and students enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at 

the 0.05 level of significance.  

Research Question 2: Is there a statistically significant difference between course 

retention rate of students in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

H2: There is a statistically significant difference in student course retention 

between students participating in online courses and students enrolled in face-to-face 

courses at the 0.05 level of significance.  

Research Question 3: Is there a statistically significant difference in program 

retention between students who entered the program in online classes and students who 

entered the program in traditional face-to-face classes? 

H3: There is a statistically significant difference in program retention between 

students who begin the Technology Administration program in online courses and 

students who begin in face-to-face courses at the 0.05 level of significance. 

Population and Sample 

The two populations selected were students enrolled in online and face-to-face 

courses. The sample included students enrolled in Technology Administration courses. 

Student enrollment was analyzed for all Technology Administration courses in the 

program sequence to determine the number of samples available in online and face-to-

face classes. The course enrollment data for the sample are outlined in Table E1. The 

subsample of the data utilized for the study is presented in Table 1.

Note: TA 300 Evolution and Development of Technology, TA 310 Technology and Society 

The subsample for hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 included all students enrolled in 

two entry-level courses required for completion of the Technology Administration 

program: TA 300 Evolution and Development of Technology, and TA 310 Society and 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
38 

Technology. The university offered the courses in online and face-to-face formats during 

the period of the study. Two instructors, identified as A and B, were involved with 

teaching the online and face-to-face courses. Two courses were selected that met the 

following criteria: (a) the same faculty member taught both courses, (b) the courses were 

offered over the period of the study consistently in online and face-to-face instruction, 

and (c) the syllabi for simultaneous online and face-to-face sections were identical. 

For hypothesis 3, data included records of all students enrolled in TA 300 

Evolution and Development of Technology for the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 

2005, and 2006. The course was selected for inclusion in the study based on the 

following criteria: (a) student enrollment in the course was the result of declaration of the 

Technology Administration program major and (b) parameters of the study allowed 

students 2 or more years to complete the program requirements. For the purpose of the 

study, all student names were removed. 

Data Collection 

An Institutional Review Board (IRB) form was prepared for Washburn University 

approval prior to data collection. The study was designated as an exempt study. The 

Washburn University IRB form is provided in Appendix A. Approval of the IRB was 

transmitted by e-mail. A copy is located in Appendix B. In addition, an IRB was 

submitted to Baker University. The form is located in Appendix C. The Baker IRB 

approval letter is located in Appendix D. 

Washburn University had two types of data collection systems in place during the 

period identified for the study, Spring 2002 through Spring 2008. The AS 400 data 

collection system generated paper reports for 2002 and 2003. The researcher was allowed 


 
39 

access to paper records for 2002 and 2003. Enrollment results for all technology 

administration sections for 2002-2003 were entered manually into an Excel spreadsheet.  

In 2004, the University transferred to the Banner electronic student data 

management system. All records since 2004 were archived electronically and were 

retrieved utilizing the following filters for data specific to students enrolled in the 

identified Technology Administration courses: TA course designation and specific 

coding for year and semester to be analyzed (01 = Spring semester, 03 = Fall semester, 

200X for specified year). Results retrieved under the Banner system were saved as an 

Excel spreadsheet by the researcher. The course enrollment data for the sample are 

presented in Tables E1 and E2. 

Student transcripts and records were analyzed to determine program completion 

or continued enrollment in the program for program retention analysis. Documents 

examined included paper student advising files located within the Technology 

Administration department and specific student records housed within the Banner 

reporting system. Technology Administration course TA 300 was selected based on the 

following: (a) It is a required entry course only for Technology Administration majors, 

and (b) TA 310 is a dual enrollment course for business department majors. 

Data Analysis 

Data analysis for all hypothesis testing was conducted utilizing SPSS software 

version 16.0. The software system provided automated analysis of the statistical 

measures. 

To address Research Question 1, a two-factor analysis of variance was used to 

analyze for a potential difference in delivery method (online and face-to-face), potential 


40 

difference in instructor (instructors A and B), and potential interaction between the two 

factors. When the analysis of variance reveals a difference between the levels of any 

factor, Salkind (2008) referred to this as the main effect. This analysis produces three F 

statistics: to determine if a difference in grades of online students as compared to their 

classroom based counterparts was affected by a main effect for delivery, a main effect for 

instructor, and for interaction between instructor and delivery. 

Chi-square testing was selected to address research questions 2 and 3. The 

rationale for selecting chi-square testing was to observe whether a specific distribution of 

frequencies is the same as if it were to occur by chance (Salkind, 2008). If the obtained 

chi-square value is greater than the critical value, it indicates there is sufficient evidence 

to believe the research hypothesis is true. For research question 2, a chi-square test for 

differences between proportions analyzed course retention of online and face-to-face 

students at the end of semester. For Research Question 3, a chi-square test for differences 

between proportions analyzed program retention comparing students who began the 

program in the online section of TA 300 to the students who began in the face-to-face 

section. 

Limitations of the Study 

Roberts (2004) defined the limitations of the study as those features of the study 

that may affect the results of the study or the ability to generalize the results. The 

limitations of this study included (a) potential for data entry error, (b) curriculum 

modifications not reflected in the syllabi made by instructors over the period of the study, 

(c) behavior of the instructors during delivery in the two different formats, and (d) 


 
41 

rationale of students for selecting one course delivery method over another. These may 

affect the generalizability of this study to other populations. 

Summary 

This chapter described the research design, population and sample, hypotheses, 

data collection, and analysis used in this research study. Statistical analysis using two-

way analysis of variance and chi-square were used to determine if there are significant 

statistical differences in the course grades, course retention, and program retention of 

students enrolled in online classes as compared to their face-to face counterparts. The 

results of this study are presented in Chapter Four.

CHAPTER FOUR 

RESULTS 

The study had three main purposes. The first purpose was to determine if there 

was a difference in grades between students in online classes and students in traditional 

face-to-face classes in the Technology Administration program. In addition, the study 

was designed to examine the difference in course retention rates of students in the online 

classes as compared to the face-to-face classes. The third part of the study was designed 

to examine program retention rates of students who began the program in online classes 

and students who began the program in traditional face-to-face classes.  

This chapter begins with the descriptive statistics for the sample: gender, age, 

grades by gender, and course selection of students in online or face-to-face courses by 

gender. From the three research questions, research hypotheses were developed, and the 

results of statistical analyses used to test each hypothesis are presented.  

Descriptive Statistics 

Demographic data for the sample was collected from the student data system for 

2002 through 2009. The descriptive statistics presented below include gender (n = 884), 

age (n = 880), grades by gender (n = 884) and course selection online or face-to-face by 

gender (n = 884).  

Table 2 describes the cross-tabulation of the frequencies for gender and of the 

sample selected for the study. The mean age for the sample tested was 31.06 years, with a 

standard deviation of 9.46 years. The age range of the sample was from 18 to 66 years. 

One participant did not report gender. Age was not available for three participants.

Header: Hypothesis Testing 
H1: There is a statistically significant difference in the course grades of students 

enrolled in online classes and students enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at the 

0.05 level of significance. The sample consisted of 815 students enrolled in online and 

face-to-face Technology Administration courses at Washburn University. A two-factor 

analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential difference in course grades due 

to delivery method (online and face-to-face), the potential difference due to instructor 

(instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the two independent 

variables.  

Mean and standard deviation for grades were calculated by delivery type and 

instructor. Table 5 presents the descriptive statistics. The mean of grades by delivery 

showed no significant difference between online and face-to-face instruction. 

Additionally, no significant difference in mean grade was evident when analyzed by 

instructor.

H2: There is a statistically significant difference in student course retention 

between students enrolled in online courses and students enrolled in face-to-face courses 

at the 0.05 level of significance. The sample consisted of 885 students enrolled in TA 300 

and TA 320 online and face-to-face courses. The hypothesis testing began with the 

analysis of the contingency data presented in Table 7. The data are organized with course 

selection (online or face-to-face) as the row variable and retention in the course as the 

column variable. Data were included in the retained column if a final grade was reported 

for participant. Participants who were coded as withdraw or withdraw failing were 

labeled as not retained. Chi-square analysis was selected to observe whether a specific 

distribution of frequencies is the same as if it were to occur by chance (Roberts, 2004).  

The result of the chi square testing (X2 =  2.524, p = .112, df = 1, 884) indicated 

there was no statistically significant difference between retention of students enrolled in 

online courses compared to students enrolled in face-to-face courses in the TA program. 

Additional results indicated that 93.92% (294/313) of the online students were retained, 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to 90.89% (519/571) of the face-to-face students. The research hypothesis was

consisted of 249 students enrolled in TA 300 in the online and face-to-face courses from 

Fall 2002 through Fall 2008. The hypothesis testing began with the analysis of the 

contingency data located in Table 8. The table is organized with course selection (online 

or face-to-face) as the row variable and program retention as the column variable. Data 

were included in the retention column if students had successfully met requirements for a 

Bachelors of Applied Science in Technology Administration or if they were enrolled in 

the program in Spring 2009. Data were included in the non-retained column if students 

had not fulfilled degree requirements and they were not enrolled in Spring 2009. Chi-

square analysis was selected to observe whether a specific distribution of frequencies is 

the same as if it were to occur by chance (Roberts, 2004).  


 
 
 
 
 
49 

The result of the chi-square testing (X2 = .132, p = .717, df = 1, 249) indicated 

there was no statistically significant difference between the program retention rate of 

students who began the TA program in the online courses compared to the students who 

began the program in the face-to-face courses. Additional results showed that 91.57% 

(163/178) of students who began in online courses were retained compared to 92.96% 

(66/71) of students who began the TA program in face-to-face courses. The research 

hypothesis was not supported.

CHAPTER ONE 

INTRODUCTION 

Historically, postsecondary education in the United States was founded on the 

principles of the European system, requiring the physical presence of professors and 

students in the same location (Knowles, 1994). From 1626, with the founding of Harvard 

University (The Harvard Guide, 2004), to the development of junior colleges and 

vocational schools in the early 1900s (Cohen & Brawer, 1996; Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), 

the higher education system developed to prepare post-high school students for one of 

three separate tiers. The college and university system in the United States developed its 

own set of structures designed to prepare students for baccalaureate and graduate degrees. 

Junior colleges were limited to associate degrees, while vocational education institutions 

offered occupational certificates. In many cases, there was inadequate recognition of the 

postsecondary education offered at junior colleges and vocational education institutions, 

resulting in the inability of students to transfer to 4-year institutions (National Center for 

Education Statistics, 2006).  

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges began to provide academic, 

vocational, and personal development educational offerings for members of the local 

communities. During this same period, junior or community colleges developed a role as 

transfer institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or 

distance, could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & 

Brawer, 1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs involved Associate 

of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Associate of Applied Science 

(AAS) degrees were developed during the 1990s. The AAS degree was granted to those 


2 

who successfully completed the majority of their college program in vocational 

education. The creation of a variety of applied baccalaureate degrees allowed students 

who had previously thought of the AAS degree as a terminal program to complete a 

baccalaureate degree (Kansas Board of Regents, 2002-2003).  

Online education also became a strategy for students to access higher education in 

the 1990s (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). The proliferation of online courses alleviated some 

of the location-bound barriers to higher education, but online education was criticized as 

less rigorous than traditional classroom-based course work by traditional academicians. 

Russell attempted to address this argument with his 1999 meta-analysis of studies dating 

from the 1920s and covering multiple delivery models, including online education. 

Russell concluded there was no statistically significant difference in student achievement 

between courses offered online and those offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

Since the development of correspondence courses in the 1920s, researchers have 

attempted to ascertain if students participating in distance education are being 

shortchanged in their educational goals. No significant difference in grades has been 

found in the majority of studies designed to address this issue. Studies analyzing online 

student retention have shown significantly lower retention for online students.  In the last 

10 years, research studies have expanded to include variations of online education. These 

include strictly online, hybrid courses, Web-assisted classroom settings, and the 

traditional higher education course offered only as face-to-face instruction (Carmel & 

Gold, 2007).  

Online education continues to proliferate at the same time the number of 

secondary students in the United States overall is projected to increase (National Center 


3 

for Education Statistics [NCES], 2006). The projected increase of potential postsecondary 

students and online postsecondary options provides opportunities for increases in online 

education programs and courses. In 2000, NCES reported that over 65% of students in 

higher education were participating in online courses. In a 2007 study, Allen and Seaman 

estimated only 16% of those enrolled in online education courses are undergraduate 

students seeking their first degree, counter to the projected increase in traditional-age 

students. The majority of enrollees in online education are adults updating or advancing 

their credentials, creating an additional educational market for colleges and universities 

seeking to expand enrollment without adding physical space (Allen & Seaman, 2007a). 

For states and localities faced with a contradictory traditional-age enrollment decrease, 

these figures present an untapped market for higher education courses and programs. 

Background 

Researchers attempted to analyze the efficacy of distance education as far back as 

the 1920s when correspondence courses were created to meet the need of students not 

willing to attend a traditional classroom-based higher education setting. A meta-analysis 

of these studies resulted in The No Significant Difference Phenomenon, reported by 

Russell (2001). The results of over 355 studies were compiled, comparing various modes 

of delivery including correspondence, audio, television courses, and the newest wave of 

computer-facilitated instruction. Following analyses of studies completed prior to 2001, 

Russell concluded there was no difference in learning between students enrolled in 

distance education and those completing courses in the traditional setting.  

Studies completed since then have provided mixed results. Summers, Waigand, 

and Whittaker (2005) found there was no difference in GPA and retention between the 


4 

online and traditional classroom. Arle (2002) found higher achievement by online 

students, and Brown and Liedholm (2002) found GPA and student retention better in a 

traditional classroom setting.  

Student retention is an integral part of the student achievement conversation and 

is an issue for all forms of higher education. Degree-seeking students overall retention 

has been reported as less than 56% by NCES (2001). Long considered a problem in 

higher education, attention to the distance education model has shown even lower 

retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college 

setting (Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). Research on different modalities, such as fully 

online and hybrid online courses, has produced mixed results (Carmel & Gold, 2007). No 

significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities 

has been documented.  

Retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined 

students transfering from a community college. Statistics have consistantly shown a 

lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a 4-year 

university than for students who began their post-high school education at a 4-year 

institution (NCES, 2006). Townsends studies of transfer students at the University of 

Missouri-Columbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who 

had completed an AAS degree than for students beginning their education at a 4-year 

institution (Townsend, 2002). 

Occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively 

new to higher education. Transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges 

to 4-year institutions were common by the 1990s. Townsend (2001), in her study 


 
5 

conducted at the University of MissouriColumbia, observed the blurring of the lines 

between non-transferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and 

undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred. The study conducted 

by Townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their 

education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that 

grew after their completion of an occupationally-oriented degree. Laanan proposed that 

the increase in institutions offering AAS degrees necessitated new ways to transfer 

undergraduate credits (2003).  

The setting of this study is a medium-sized Midwestern campus located in 

Topeka, Kansas. Washburn University enrolls approximately 6000 students a year in 

undergraduate and graduate programs, including liberal arts, professional schools, and a 

law school (Washburn University, 2008). The Technology Administration (TA) program 

selected for the present study began in the 1990s as a baccalaureate degree completion 

program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a 

Kansas community college or through Washburns articulation agreement with Kansas 

vocational-technical schools. This program provided students who previously had 

obtained an Associate of Applied Science degree in an occupational area an opportunity 

to earn a bachelors degree. 

Peterson, Dean of Continuing Education, Washburn University, stated that in 

early 1999, Washburn University began online courses and programs at the behest of a 

neighboring community college (personal communication, April 18, 2008). Washburn 

was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students 

graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an Associate of Applied 


6 

Science degree. The TA program was among the first programs to offer the online 

bachelors degree completion option. The TA program offered its first online courses in 

Spring 2000.  

Online education at Washburn expanded to other programs and courses, to 

include over 200 courses (Washburn University, 2008). The original online partnership 

with two community colleges expanded to include 16 additional community colleges and 

four technical colleges in Kansas, as well as colleges in Missouri, California, Wisconsin, 

South Carolina, and Nebraska (Washburn University, 2008). 

An initial study in 2002 of students course grades and retention in online courses 

offered at Washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face course work (Peterson,  personal 

communication, April 18, 2008). No studies of program retention have been completed.  

In 2008, Atkins reported overall enrollment at Washburn University decreased 

6.7% from Fall 2004 to Fall 2008, from 7400 to 6901 students. During the same period, 

online course enrollment patterns increased 65%, from 3550 students to 5874 in 2007-

2008 (Washburn University, 2008). Atkins also reported that between 1998 and 2008, the 

ratio of traditional post-high school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at 

Washburn University reversed from 40:60 to 60:40. The shift in enrollment patterns 

produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the 21st century; however, 

Washburn University anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in Kansas through 

2016, based on demographic patterns of the state. The state figures are opposite the 

anticipated increase of traditional-age students nationally (NCES, 2008). The increase in 


distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditional-age 

students provided the focus for the study.

Purpose of the Study 

Online education has become an important strategy for the higher education 

institution that was the setting of this study. First, the purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students 

participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The 

second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference 

between course retention of students participating in TA online courses and their 

traditional classroom-based counterparts. The second part of the study was a replication 

of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroom-based 

instruction (Carmel & Gold, 2007; Russell, 1999). A third purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who 

began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in 

traditional face-to-face courses. The studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base 

concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree 

completion opportunities. 

Research Questions 

Roberts (2004) stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the 

structure for presenting the results of the research. The research questions guiding this 

study were: 


 
8 

1. 

Is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in 

online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

2. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates 

in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

3. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for 

students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students 

entering the program enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes? 

Overview of the Methodology 

A quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course, course retention, 

and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-face TA 

program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at Washburn 

University were utilized from comparative online and traditional face-to-face classes in 

two separate courses. In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of 885 students 

enrolled in online and traditional face-to-face courses was identified. The sample 

included students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 

and 2006 in both the online and traditional face-to-face classes. Two instructors were 

responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-to-face classes for the 

period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential 

difference in the dependent variables, course grades due to delivery method (online and 

face-to-face), instructor (instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the 

two independent variables (Research Question 1). A chi-square test for differences 

among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention (Research 

Questions 2 and 3).

CHAPTER TWO 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

This chapter presents the background for research into the efficacy of distance 

education in the delivery of higher education. Research studies have focused primarily on 

grades as a measure of the quality of distance education courses as compared to 

traditional face-to-face instruction. Utilizing grades has produced a dividing line among 

education researchers concerning the use of distance education as a delivery model. 

Retention in distance education has focused primarily on single courses, with little 

program retention data available. Data from retention studies in higher education have 

focused primarily on the traditional 4-year university student. Retention studies of 

community college students have produced quantitative results; however, these studies 

have been directed at community college students who identify themselves as transfer 

students early in their community college careers. Retention studies of students enrolled 

in occupationally oriented programs are limited. 

Statistical data of higher education shows an increased use of distance education 

for traditional academic courses as well as occupationally oriented courses. The increase 

in distance education courses and programs has provided a new dimension to studies of 

both grades and retention. The recognition of this increase, as well as questions 

concerning its impact on student learning and retention, produced the impetus for this 

study. 

The following review of the literature represents the literature related to this 

research study. Through examination of previous research, the direction of the present 

study was formulated. Specifically, the chapter is organized into four sections: (a) the 


13 

history of occupational transfer programs; (b) the history and research of distance 

education, including occupational transfer programs utilizing distance education; (c) 

research utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning in online education; and (d) 

research focusing on student retention in higher education, including student retention 

issues in transfer education and online transfer courses and programs. 

History of Occupational Transfer Programs 

The measure of success in higher education has been characterized as the 

attainment of a bachelors degree at a 4-year university. Occupationally oriented 

education was considered primarily a function of job preparation, and until the 1990s was 

not considered transferrable to other higher education institutions. Occupational transfer 

programs are a recent occurrence within the postsecondary system that provides an 

additional pathway to bachelors degree completion.  

Historically, the postsecondary experience in the United States developed as a 

three-track system. Colleges were established in the United States in 1636 with the 

founding of Harvard College (The Harvard Guide, 2004). Junior colleges were first 

founded in 1901 as experimental post-high school graduate programs (Joliet Junior 

College History, 2008). Their role was initially as a transfer institution to the university. 

When the Smith-Hughes Act was passed in 1917, a system of vocational education was 

born in the United States (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), and was designed to provide further 

education to those students not viewed as capable of success in a university setting. 

Vocational education, currently referred to as occupational or technical education, 

was not originally designed to be a path to higher education. The first programs were 

designed to help agricultural workers complete their education and increase their skills. 


14 

More vocational programs were developed during the early 20th century as 

industrialization developed and as increasing numbers of skills were needed by workers 

in blue-collar occupations (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003). 

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges expanded their programs beyond 

academic selections to provide occupational development and continuing education. 

Because of the geographic area from which they attracted students, junior colleges 

developed a role as community colleges. They also solidified their role as transfer 

institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or distance, 

could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & Brawer, 

1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs to 4-year universities 

involved traditional academic degrees, including the Associate of Arts (AA) and 

Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Occupational programs and continuing education 

were viewed as terminal and non-transferrable. 

In 1984, Congress authorized the Carl Perkins Vocational and Technical 

Education Act (P.L. 98-524). In the legislation, Congress responded to employers 

concerns about the lack of basic skills in employees by adding academic requirements to 

vocational education legislation. Vocational program curriculum was expanded to include 

language arts, mathematics, and science principles, and the curriculum reflected the 

context of the program. The Secretarys Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills 

(SCANS) was created in 1990 to determine the skills young people need to succeed in the 

world of work (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). In the second Carl Perkins 

reauthorization in 1990 (P.L. 105-332), Congress responded to the report, which targeted 

academic and job skills, by outlining a seamless system of vocational and academic 


15 

education to prepare vocational students to progress into and through higher education. 

This emphasis led to the development of Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees 

during the 1990s. Granted to those who have successfully completed programs in the 

applied arts and sciences for careers, AAS degrees were seen as terminal (Kansas Board 

of Regents, 2002-2003). 

But as one goal was attained, conversation turned to creating a pathway from 

occupational associate degrees to bachelors degree completion. The desire of students to 

continue from technical degrees to a baccalaureate was not a new idea. In a paper 

presented in 1989 to the American Technical Association national conference, Troutt-

Ervin and Morgans overview of 2+2 programs showed acceptance of AAS degrees at 

traditional universities was generally non-existent. Their suggestion for an academic 

bridge from early technical education to baccalaureate programs highlighted programs 

accepting AAS degrees toward baccalaureate completion were an exception rather than a 

rule (Troutt-Ervin & Morgan, 1989). It was not until the late 1990s that applied 

baccalaureate degrees recognized credits from technical degree students who had 

previously thought of themselves in a terminal program to complete their baccalaureate 

degree (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the advance of recognition of AAS degrees, standard definitions of 

transfer students continued to exclude students who completed technical programs. The 

U.S. Department of Education did not include students receiving an Associate of Applied 

Science degree in the definition of students preparing for transfer to 4-year colleges 

(Bradburn, Hurst, & Peng, 2001; Carnevale, 2006). Most states had comparable policies 

in place concerning core academic curriculum, articulation agreements, transfer of credit, 


16 

and statewide transfer guides. There was no general recognition of occupational credit 

transfer. Only a few states, including Kansas, Missouri, and Washington, allowed credits 

earned in occupationally oriented degrees to transfer to 4-year institutions (Townsend, 

2001). No state had set clear goals for the transference of occupational credits between 

institutions or for the state as a whole (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the lack of recognition of occupational transfer credit at the federal level, 

a new definition of transfer education had emerged. Initially defined as the general 

education component of the first 2 years of a baccalaureate, the definition of transfer 

education now included any courses that transferred to a 4-year college, regardless of the 

nature of the courses (Townsend, 2001).  

The line between vocational schools, community colleges, and 4-year institutions 

blurred in the United States as employers and students increasingly made business 

decisions regarding education and workforce development. Employers increasingly asked 

for employees with academic and technical skills, as well as critical thinking skills and 

personal responsibility (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). Returning students themselves 

were more attuned to the demands of the 21st century workforce. Their desire to return to 

higher education, coupled with the economy and the variety of options available to them, 

required a more adaptive higher education system (Carnevale, 2006). There was growing 

demand among new and returning students for higher education opportunities responsive 

to their needs. The expanding needs of the returning student provided opportunities for 

higher education to respond by utilizing different delivery models. 


 
 
17 

Distance Education 

Online education became a strategy for postsecondary institutions when the first 

correspondence courses were initiated with the mail service in the early 20th century 

(Russell, 1999). As various technologies emerged, distance education utilized television 

and video models, in addition to paper-based correspondence courses. The expansion of 

distance education utilizing computer technologies renewed academic debate over the 

efficacy of the delivery model. 

Online education utilizing the Internet became a significant factor in the 1990s, 

prompting renewed evaluation of the use of distance learning opportunities (Russell, 

1999, Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). In 19992000, the number of students who took any 

distance education courses was 8.4% of total undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary 

education (NCES, 2000). In 2000, the report of the Web-Based Education Commission to 

the President and Congress concluded that the Internet was no longer in question as a tool 

to transform the way teaching and learning was offered. The Commission recommended 

that the nation embrace E-learning as a strategy to provide on-demand, high-quality 

teaching and professional development to keep the United States competitive in the 

global workforce. They also recommended continued funding of research into teaching 

and learning utilizing web-based resources (Web-Based Education Commission, 2000). 

The acceptance of the importance of the Internet for delivery of higher education opened 

new opportunities for research and continued the academic debate of the quality of 

instruction delivered in online education courses and programs. 

In a longitudinal study from 2002-2007, The Sloan Consortium, a group of higher 

education institutions actively involved in online education, began studies of online 


18 

education in the United States over a period of 5 years. In the first study, researchers 

Allen and Seaman (2003) conducted polls of postsecondary institutions involved with 

online education and found that students overwhelming responded to the availability of 

online education, with over 1.6 million students taking at least one online course during 

the Fall semester of 2002. Over one third of these students took all of their courses 

online. The survey also found that in 2002, 81% of all institutions of higher education 

offered at least one fully online or blended course (Allen & Seaman, 2003). 

In their intermediate report in 2005, Allen and Seaman postulated that online 

education had continued to make inroads in postsecondary education, with 65% of 

schools offering graduate courses and programs face-to-face also offering graduate 

courses online. Sixty-three percent of undergraduate institutions offering face-to-face 

courses also offered courses online. From 2003 to 2005, the survey results showed that 

online education, as a long-term strategy for institutions, had increased from 49% to 56%. 

In addition, core education online course offerings had increased (Allen & Seaman, 

2005). 

In Allen and Seamans final report (2007b) for the Sloan Consortium, the 

researchers reported that almost 3.5 million students participated in at least one online 

course during the Fall 2006 term, a nearly 10% increase over the number reported in the 

previous year. Allen and Seaman also reported a 9.7% increase in online enrollment, 

compared to the 1.5% growth in overall higher education. They found by 2007, 2-year 

institutions had the highest growth rates and accounted for over the half the online 

enrollments in the previous 5 years. The researchers concluded, based on a survey 


 
 
19 

conducted as part of the research, institutions believed that improved student access was 

the top reason for offering online courses and programs (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). 

Community colleges began embracing distance education in the 1920s as part of 

their mission to provide low-cost, time-effective education. Community colleges initially 

provided correspondence courses by mail, but later switched to television and video 

courses as technology improved (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). In 2001, over 90% of public 2-

year colleges in the United States provided distance education courses over the Internet 

(NCES, 2001).  

Vocational education, by the nature of its instructional format, was among the last 

of the educational institutions to participate in distance education. Because of the 

kinesthetic nature of instruction, vocational education leaders began investigating 

distance education opportunities in the 1990s, relying on the method to provide only the 

lecture portion of instruction. By 2004, only 31% of students enrolled in vocational 

schools had participated in some form of distance education during their program of 

study (NCES, 2005). In 2008, hands-on instruction in programs such as automobile 

mechanics and welding, and the clinical portion of health occupations programs, 

continued to be taught in the traditional classroom setting (NCES, 2008). 

Analysis of data reported by the NCES indicated that distance education had 

become a staple for higher education institutions. At both the 4-year and 2-year university 

level, over 65% of institutions offered more than 12 million courses in 2006-2007 by 

distance education. While vocational education had traditionally been more hands-on, 

distance education had become more prevalent in providing opportunities for students to 

participate in components of the system over the Internet (NCES, 2008).  


 
 
 
20 

Distance education became the prevalent strategy for higher education institutions 

to expand their services to new and returning students, without the financial implications 

of capital expansion. Higher education utilized the strategy to market to students outside 

their traditional geographic reach by utilizing the power of the Internet. The increasing 

demand from students of all ages for online opportunities provided new ground for the 

expansion of higher education opportunities. 

Grades as an Indicator of Quality of Student Learning 

The grading system in the United States educational system has served as an 

indicator of knowledge for over 100 years. Educators have utilized high school grades as 

a sorting mechanism in American schools to determine postsecondary opportunities. 

Modern society has accepted honors attainment, graduation honors, and course grades as 

an indicator of knowledge acquisition in postsecondary education. Stray (2001) reported 

that the use of grading in schools can be traced to the industrial revolution and the 

development of factories.  

William Farish of Cambridge University developed the first grading system in 

higher education in 1792 (Stray, 2001). Farish mimicked the system established by 

factories of the time: grade A being the best. The thought was that Farish employed the 

grading system in order to teach more students, an aberration at that time when 

instructors rarely had more than a few. The demand for more higher education 

opportunities prompted Farish to open his class to more students, and as such, led to his 

use of a sorting system. This was the first known record of grading utilized in classrooms 

to measure student achievement (Stray, 2001). 


 
21 

Smallwood (1935) reported the first grading in higher education at Yale 

University in 1792. Stiles, President of Yale University, directed the use of the scale in 

the late 18th century. However, Smallwood noted it was not until 1813 that any record of 

grades or marking appeared. 

Using a scale of 100, philosophy and mathematic professors instituted the first use 

of a marking instrument in the 1800s at Harvard. Smallwood noted early systems were 

experimental, utilizing different numerical scales, with no standardized system in place 

between higher education institutions. It was not until the late 1800s that faculty began 

using descriptors, such as A and B, to rank students according to a predetermined 

numerical scale (Smallwood, 1935).  

Experimentation with evaluation of achievement continued into the early 20th 

century, when educational psychologists, including Dewey and Thorndike, attempted to 

compare grading scales with intelligence testing. Thorndikes philosophy of standardized 

testing and grading survived the 20th century, and his quote, Whatever exists at all exists 

in some amount (Thorndike, 1916, as cited in Ebel & Frisbie, p. 26) has been utilized in 

educational measurement textbooks as a validation of the use of standards of 

measurement to measure achievement (Ebel & Frisbie, 1991). 

The use of grades expanded to community colleges, high schools, and elementary 

schools in the early 1900s (Pressey, 1920). The use of grades throughout the educational 

system is fairly standardized today with the 4.0 scale. It is this standardization that allows 

comparison of grades as achievement between educational levels and institutions (Ebel & 

Frisbie, 1991) and allows grades to be utilized as a measure for comparison of 

educational achievement. 


22 

Researchers analyzing the success of community college transfer students have 

traditionally studied the grades of the traditional transfer student with an AA or AS 

degree. Keeley and Houses 1993 study of sophomore and junior transfer students at 

Northern Illinois University analyzed transfer shock (p. 2) for students matriculating 

from community colleges. The researchers found students who transferred from a 

community college obtained a grade point average significantly lower in their first 

semester than did students who began their college career at a 4-year institution. 

However, the results of the longitudinal studies showed that transfer students who 

persisted to graduation showed an equivalent GPA at baccalaureate completion (Keeley 

& House, 1993).  

Students who transferred from occupationally oriented degree programs typically 

were not included in traditional studies of transfer students. While the research in general 

does not include AAS students in traditional transfer data, limited conclusions were 

available comparing AAS students to traditional 4-year college attendees. Townsends 

study at the University of Missouri-Columbia (2002) showed no difference in grades at 

baccalaureate graduation between students with an AA/AS degree and students with an 

AAS degree.  

The use of grades as an indicator of the level of student achievement has been 

relied upon by studies comparing traditional classroom instruction and distance 

instruction. Research analyzing the effectiveness of student learning in distance education 

began with the first correspondence courses offered utilizing the mail service (Russell, 

1999). The study of effectiveness of correspondence courses expanded to include new 

technologies, such as television and video courses, and increased with the proliferation of 


 
23 

online educational offerings. Researchers continued to challenge the effectiveness of 

learning methods not delivered in traditional higher education settings. 

In 1991, Russell reviewed over 355 studies, dating from the 1930s and continuing 

through the late 1980s, and found no significant difference in student learning using any 

form of distance education, as compared with students in classroom-based instruction 

(Russell, 1999). Russells conclusion formed the basis for a series of works collectively 

known as No Significant Difference. Russells conclusion from his studies follows: 

The fact is the findings of comparative studies are absolutely conclusive; one can 

bank on them. No matter how it is produced, how it is delivered, whether or not it 

is interactive, low tech or high tech, students learn equally well with each 

technology and learn as well as their on-campus, face-to-face counterparts even 

though students would rather be on campus with the instructor if that were a real 

choice. (p. xviii) 

Overwhelmingly, studies have supported Russells conclusions, including 

Neuhausers (2002) study of traditional face-to-face education and online education in a 

business communications class at a large urban university in North Carolina. Neuhauser 

concluded there was no significant difference in pre- and post-test scores of students 

enrolled in online and traditional communications classes. In addition, Neuhauser found 

no significant difference in final grades, homework grades, and grades on research 

papers, even though learners in the online course were significantly older than were 

learners in the traditional face-to-face section.  

The Summers et al. (2005) research included a comparison of student 

achievement and satisfaction in an online versus a traditional face-to-face statistics class. 


24 

The study, conducted at the University of Missouri-Columbia, included undergraduate 

nursing students who were tested on both their pre- and post-course knowledge of 

statistics. Their results indicated that utilizing grades as an indicator of knowledge 

showed no significant difference between the online and traditional classroom students. 

In their meta-analysis, Machtmes and Asher (2002) reviewed 30 studies and concluded 

there did not appear to be a difference in achievement, as measured by grades, between 

distance and traditional learners. 

As technology use continued to evolve in online education, various studies were 

conducted to determine whether different delivery methods created a difference in the 

grades of online students compared to their face-to-face counterparts. A study conducted 

by Carmel and Gold (2007) supported Russells original conclusion by analyzing specific 

types of online platforms and delivery models. Carmel and Golds study included hybrid 

and traditional classroom-based instruction. They analyzed results from 164 students in 

110 courses and found no significant difference in student achievement based on grades 

between students enrolled in either delivery method.  

Additional studies supporting Russells theory have crossed multiple content 

areas and delivery models. Brown and Liedholms (2002) study at Michigan State 

University included microeconomics students in virtual, hybrid, and traditional 

classroom-based instruction. The study included 389 students in the traditional setting, 

258 in the hybrid delivery section and 89 students enrolled in online education.  No 

significant difference in student learning as measured by end of course grades was found. 

Research also showed type of course discipline is not affected by the online 

delivery model. Schulman and Simms (1999) compared pretest and posttest scores of 


25 

students enrolled in an online course and a traditional course at Nova Southeastern 

University. The researchers compared 40 undergraduate students enrolled in online 

courses and 59 undergraduate students enrolled in the classroom setting of the same 

course. Results indicated that the students who select online courses scored higher than 

traditional students scored on the pretest results. However, posttest results showed no 

significant difference for the online students versus the in-class students. Schulman and 

Simms concluded that online students were learning equally as well as their classroom-

based counterparts. Reigles (2007) analysis across disciplines at the University of San 

Francisco and the University of California found no significant difference between online 

and face-to-face student grade attainment. 

Shachar and Neumann (2003) conducted a meta-analysis that estimated and 

compared the differences between the academic performance of students enrolled in 

distance education compared to those enrolled in traditional settings over the period from 

1990-2002. Eighty-six studies containing data from over 15,000 participating students 

were included in their analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that in two-thirds 

of the cases, students taking courses by distance education outperformed their student 

counterparts enrolled in traditionally instructed courses.  

Lynch, during the use of the Tegrity system, a brand-specific online platform at 

Louisiana State University, found that students grades were slightly better after utilizing 

the technology than when the traditional approach was used (Lynch, 2002). Initial results 

of a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study of 5000 students over 2 years indicated 

that the U-Pace online students performed 12% better than their traditional Psychology 

101 counterparts on the same cumulative test (Perez, 2009). Arles (2002) study found 


26 

students enrolled in online human anatomy courses at Rio Salado College scored an 

average of 6.3% higher on assessments than the national achievement average. Students 

were assessed using a national standardized test generated by the Human Anatomy and 

Physiology Society, whose norming sample is based entirely on traditional classroom 

delivery (Arle, 2002).  

In a study conducted by Stephenson, Brown, and Griffin (2008), comparing three 

different delivery styles (traditional, asynchronous electronic courseware, and 

synchronous e-lectures), results indicated no increased effectiveness of any delivery style 

when all question types were taken into account. However, when results were analyzed, 

students receiving traditional lectures showed the lowest levels on questions designed to 

assess comprehension.  

Research found supporters in higher education academic leaders. In a 2006 survey 

of Midwestern postsecondary institutions concerning their online offerings, 56 % of 

academic leaders in the 11 states rated the learning outcomes in online education as the 

same or superior to those in face-to-face instructional settings. The proportion of higher 

education institutions believing that online learning outcomes were superior to those for 

face-to-face outcomes was still relatively small, but had grown by 34% since 2003, from 

10.2 to 13.7 % (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). This belief added merit to the conclusions 

supported by Russell and others. 

Russells (1999) no significant difference conclusion had its detractors. The 

most commonly cited is Phipps and Merisotis (1999), who reviewed Russells original 

meta-analysis (1999) and reported a much different conclusion. They concluded that the 

overall quality of the original research was questionable, that much of the research did 


27 

not control for extraneous variables, and therefore it could not show cause and effect. 

They included in their findings evidence that the studies utilized by Russell (2000) in the 

meta-analysis did not use randomly selected subjects, did not take into effect the 

differences among students, and did not include tests of validity and reliability.  

The  Phipps and Merisotis (1999) analysis included the conclusion that research 

has focused too much on individual courses rather than on academic programs, and has 

not taken into account differences among students. They postulated that based on these 

conclusions, there is a significant difference in the learning results, as evidenced by 

grades, of students participating in distance education as compared to their classroom-

based peers. Their analysis of Russells original work questioned both the quality and 

effectiveness of research comparing distance and traditional education delivery.  

While there has been ongoing conjecture that online education students are not 

receiving an equivalent learning experience compared to their traditional classroom 

counterparts, studies utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning have produced 

little evidence of the disparity. The incidence of studies showing significant negative 

differences in grades of online learners is small. Higher education institutions have 

indicated their support for online education, and its continued growth has allowed studies 

such as the present research to contribute to ongoing dialogue. 

Student Retention in Postsecondary Education 

Persistence and retention in higher education is an issue that has intrigued 

researchers for over 50 years. Quantitative studies conducted in the mid-20th century 

produced data that caused researchers to look at low retention rates in higher education 


28 

and search for answers. This question has continued to consume researchers and higher 

education institutions. 

In 1987, Tinto attempted to summarize studies of individual student retention in 

higher education by proposing a theory to allow higher education administrators to 

predict success and support students (Tinto, 1987). Tintos model of student engagement 

has been in use for over 20 years as higher education administrators and faculty attempt 

to explain student retention issues at universities and colleges. Tintos model primarily 

focused on factors of student engagement: How students respond to instructors, the 

higher education community itself, and students own engagement in learning are the 

primary factors Tinto theorized as determining the students retention. In the concluding 

remarks to his 1987 treatise on retention, Tinto acknowledged that persistence in higher 

education is but one facet of human growth and development, and one that cannot 

necessarily be attributed to a single factor or strategy. 

Tintos (1987) original study of student retention included the observation that 

student retention is a complicated web of events that shape student leaving and 

persistence. He observed that the view of student retention had changed since the 1950s, 

when students were thought to leave due to lack of motivation, persistence, and skills, 

hence the name dropout. In the 1970s, research began to focus on the role of the 

environment in student decisions to stay or leave. In the 1990s, Tinto proposed that the 

actions of the faculty were the key to institutional efforts to enhance student retention 

(Tinto, 2007). This was a significant addition to his theory, placing the cause on the 

instructor instead of the student, and it has done much to influence retention strategies 


29 

utilized in higher education institutions (Tinto, 2007). Tintos studies have driven 

research in both traditional retention studies and those involving distance education.  

Studies of the persistence of the postsecondary student routinely focus on 4-year 

postsecondary education. It is only within the last 20 years that persistence studies have 

included community college students and occupational students, acknowledging that their 

reasons for entering the postsecondary community are different from the traditional 4-

year higher education participant (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). With different avenues to a 

baccalaureate degree more prevalent, the research into college persistence has expanded 

to include other types of programs and students. 

Postsecondary student retention rates routinely utilize data from longitudinal 

studies of students entering in a Fall semester and completing a bachelors program no 

more than 6 years later (NCES, 2003). The National Center for Education Statistics 

reported that 55% of those seeking a baccalaureate degree would complete in 6 years 

(NCES, 2003). The report acknowledged institutions are unable to follow students who 

transfer to other institutions; they are able to report only the absence of enrollment in 

their own institution.  

Research has also found a large gap between community college entrants and 4-

year college entrants in rates of attaining a bachelors degree. Dougherty (1992) reported 

that students entering community college receive 11 to 19% fewer bachelors degrees 

than students beginning at a 4-year university. Dougherty postulated that the lower 

baccalaureate attainment rate of community college entrants was attributable to both their 

individual traits and the institution they entered (Dougherty, 1992). 


30 

Studies of student retention of community college also vary based on the types of 

students. Community college retention rates are routinely reported as lower than 

traditional 4-year institutions (NCES, 2007). Cohen and Brawer (1996) attributed the 

differences in retention to the difference in the mission. In many instances, students did 

not enroll in a community college in order to attain a degree (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). 

The most recent longitudinal study in 1993 showed a retention rate of 55.4% of students 

after 3 years (NCES, 2001).  

Of community college students, only 60.9% indicated a desire to transfer later to a 

baccalaureate degree completion program (NCES, 2003). While retention data collected 

by the federal government (NCES, 2003) did not include students with an AAS degree, 

Townsends studies of the transfer rates and baccalaureate attainment rates of students in 

Missouri who had completed an Associate of Arts and students who had completed an 

Associate of Applied Science degree was 61% compared to 54% (Townsend, 2001).  

Vocational or occupational programs have reported retention rates as program 

completion, a definition involving completion of specific tasks and competencies 

instead of grades and tied to a limited program length. This state and federal requirement 

indicates program quality and ensures continued federal funding. In 2001, the U.S. 

Department of Education reported a 60.1% completion rate of postsecondary students 

enrolled in occupational education (NCES, 2007). Until 1995, the reasons for students 

leaving was neither delineated nor reported; it was not until federal reporting 

requirements under the Carl Perkins Act of 1994 that institutions were required to explore 

why students were not retained in vocational programs (P.L. 105-332). 


31 

Distance education provided a new arena for the study of student persistence. 

Theorists and researchers have attempted to utilize Tintos model of student persistence 

to explain retention issues involved with distance education. However, Rovai (2003) 

analyzed the differing student characteristics of distance learners as compared to the 

traditional students targeted by Tintos original models and concluded that student 

retention theories proposed from that population were no longer applicable to distance 

education learners. Rovai proposed that distance educators could address retention in 

ways that traditional higher education has not. He suggested that distance educators 

utilize strategies such as capitalizing on students expectations of technology, addressing 

economic benefits and specific educational needs to increase student retention in courses 

(Rovai, 2003). 

The expanded use of technology created a distinct subset of research into student 

retention issues. In 2004, Berge and Huang developed an overview of models of student 

retention, with special emphasis on models developed to explain the retention rates in 

distance education. Their studies primarily focused on the variables in student 

demographics and external factors, such as age and gender, which influence persistence 

and retention in online learning. Berge and Huang found that traditional models of 

student retention such as Tintos did not acknowledge the differences in student 

expectations and goals that are ingrained in the students selection of the online learning 

option. 

Other researchers have attempted to study retention issues specifically for online 

education. In a meta-analysis, Nora and Snyder (2009) found the majority of studies of 

online education focused on students individual characteristics and individual 


32 

perceptions of technology. Nora and Snyder concluded that researchers attempt to utilize 

traditional models of student engagement to explain student retention issues in distance or 

online learning courses, with little or no success. This supported Berge and Huards 

conclusions. Nora and Snyder (2009) also noted a dearth of quantitative research.  

Few quantitative studies exist that support higher or equal retention in online 

students compared to their classroom-based counterparts. One example is the Carmel and 

Gold (2007) study. They found no significant difference in student retention rates 

between students in distance education courses and their traditional classroom-based 

counterparts. The study utilized data from 164 students, 95 enrolled in classroom-based 

courses and 69 enrolled in a hybrid online format. Participants randomly self-selected and 

were not all enrolled in the same course, introducing variables not attributed in the study.  

The majority of quantitative studies instead concluded there is a higher retention 

rate in traditional classrooms than in distance education. In the Phipps and Merisotis 

(1999) review of Russells original research, which included online education, results 

indicated that research has shown even lower retention rates in online students than in 

students attending classes in the traditional college setting. The high dropout rate among 

distance education students was not addressed in Russells meta-analysis, and Phipps and 

Merisotis found no suitable explanation in the research. They postulated that the 

decreased retention rate documented within distance education studies skews 

achievement data by excluding the dropouts. 

Diaz (2002) found a high drop rate for online students compared to traditional 

classroom-based students in an online health education course at Nova Southeastern. 

Other studies have supported the theory that retention of online students is far below that 


33 

of the traditional campus students. In 2002, Carr, reporting for The Chronicle of Higher 

Education, noted that online courses routinely lose 50 % of students who originally 

enrolled, as compared to a retention rate of 70-75% of traditional face-to-face students. 

Carr reported dropout rates of up to 75% in online courses as a likely indicator of the 

difficultly faced in retaining distance education students who do not routinely meet with 

faculty. The data have not been refuted. 

As community colleges began utilizing distance education, retention rates were 

reported as higher than traditional students (Nash, 1984). However, the California 

Community College System report for Fall 2008 courses showed inconsistent retention 

results for distance education learners, varying by the type of course. Results indicated 

equivalent retention rates for online instruction compared to traditional coursework in the 

majority of courses. Lower retention rates were indicated in online engineering, social 

sciences, and mathematics courses as compared to traditional classroom instructional 

models (California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, 2009). 

Due to the limited number of vocational/technical or occupational courses taught 

in the online mode, there was little data on student retention. In 1997, Hogan studied 

technical course and program completion of students in distance and traditional 

vocational education and found that course completion rates were higher for distance 

education students. However, program completion rates were higher for traditional 

students than for students enrolled in distance education (Hogan, 1997).  

In summary, studies of retention have focused primarily on student characteristics 

while acknowledging that postsecondary retention rates vary according to a variety of 

factors. Research showed mixed results concerning the retention rate of online students, 


34 

though quantitative data leans heavily toward a lower course retention rate in online 

students. Data from 4-year universities have shown lower retention rates for online 

students than for traditional face-to-face students, while community colleges have shown 

inconsistent results. Data from vocational-technical education has been limited, but 

course retention rates are higher for online students, while program retention rates are 

lower. No significant research factor affecting retention has been isolated between 

students in online baccalaureate completion programs and students participating in 

traditional classroom-based settings. 

Summary 

Research studies have been conducted analyzing student retention in higher 

education, transfer and retention of students from community colleges to universities, the 

impact of distance education, and student achievement and retention factors related to 

distance education. However, no comparative research was identified that compared the 

achievement and retention of students participating in an occupationally oriented transfer 

program utilizing both online education and traditional classroom-based instruction. 

Chapter Three addresses the topics of research design, hypotheses, and research 

questions. Additionally, population and sample, data collection, and data analysis are 

discussed.

CHAPTER THREE 

METHODOLOGY 

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a significant difference 

between course grades of students enrolled in online Technology Administration courses 

and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The study also examined if there is a 

significant difference between course retention and program retention of students 

enrolled in online Technology Administration courses and their traditional classroom-

based counterparts. The methodology employed to test the research hypotheses is 

presented in this chapter. The chapter is organized into the following sections: research 

design, hypotheses and research questions, population and sample, data collection, data 

analysis, and summary. 

Research Design 

A quantitative, quasi-experimental research design was selected to study grades, 

course retention, and program retention in students enrolled in the Technology 

Administration program. The design was chosen as a means to determine if significant 

differences occur between online and face-to-face students by examining numerical 

scores from all participants enrolled, and retention rates in both courses and programs in 

the Technology Administration program.  

Hypotheses and Research Questions 

This study focused on three research questions with accompanying hypotheses. 

The research questions and hypotheses guiding the study follow. 


 
 
36 

Research Question 1: Is there is a statistically significant difference between 

students grades in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

H1: There is a statistically significant difference in course grades of students 

participating in online courses and students enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at 

the 0.05 level of significance.  

Research Question 2: Is there a statistically significant difference between course 

retention rate of students in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

H2: There is a statistically significant difference in student course retention 

between students participating in online courses and students enrolled in face-to-face 

courses at the 0.05 level of significance.  

Research Question 3: Is there a statistically significant difference in program 

retention between students who entered the program in online classes and students who 

entered the program in traditional face-to-face classes? 

H3: There is a statistically significant difference in program retention between 

students who begin the Technology Administration program in online courses and 

students who begin in face-to-face courses at the 0.05 level of significance. 

Population and Sample 

The two populations selected were students enrolled in online and face-to-face 

courses. The sample included students enrolled in Technology Administration courses. 

Student enrollment was analyzed for all Technology Administration courses in the 

program sequence to determine the number of samples available in online and face-to-

face classes. The course enrollment data for the sample are outlined in Table E1. The 

subsample of the data utilized for the study is presented in Table 1.

Note: TA 300 Evolution and Development of Technology, TA 310 Technology and Society 

The subsample for hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 included all students enrolled in 

two entry-level courses required for completion of the Technology Administration 

program: TA 300 Evolution and Development of Technology, and TA 310 Society and 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
38 

Technology. The university offered the courses in online and face-to-face formats during 

the period of the study. Two instructors, identified as A and B, were involved with 

teaching the online and face-to-face courses. Two courses were selected that met the 

following criteria: (a) the same faculty member taught both courses, (b) the courses were 

offered over the period of the study consistently in online and face-to-face instruction, 

and (c) the syllabi for simultaneous online and face-to-face sections were identical. 

For hypothesis 3, data included records of all students enrolled in TA 300 

Evolution and Development of Technology for the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 

2005, and 2006. The course was selected for inclusion in the study based on the 

following criteria: (a) student enrollment in the course was the result of declaration of the 

Technology Administration program major and (b) parameters of the study allowed 

students 2 or more years to complete the program requirements. For the purpose of the 

study, all student names were removed. 

Data Collection 

An Institutional Review Board (IRB) form was prepared for Washburn University 

approval prior to data collection. The study was designated as an exempt study. The 

Washburn University IRB form is provided in Appendix A. Approval of the IRB was 

transmitted by e-mail. A copy is located in Appendix B. In addition, an IRB was 

submitted to Baker University. The form is located in Appendix C. The Baker IRB 

approval letter is located in Appendix D. 

Washburn University had two types of data collection systems in place during the 

period identified for the study, Spring 2002 through Spring 2008. The AS 400 data 

collection system generated paper reports for 2002 and 2003. The researcher was allowed 


 
39 

access to paper records for 2002 and 2003. Enrollment results for all technology 

administration sections for 2002-2003 were entered manually into an Excel spreadsheet.  

In 2004, the University transferred to the Banner electronic student data 

management system. All records since 2004 were archived electronically and were 

retrieved utilizing the following filters for data specific to students enrolled in the 

identified Technology Administration courses: TA course designation and specific 

coding for year and semester to be analyzed (01 = Spring semester, 03 = Fall semester, 

200X for specified year). Results retrieved under the Banner system were saved as an 

Excel spreadsheet by the researcher. The course enrollment data for the sample are 

presented in Tables E1 and E2. 

Student transcripts and records were analyzed to determine program completion 

or continued enrollment in the program for program retention analysis. Documents 

examined included paper student advising files located within the Technology 

Administration department and specific student records housed within the Banner 

reporting system. Technology Administration course TA 300 was selected based on the 

following: (a) It is a required entry course only for Technology Administration majors, 

and (b) TA 310 is a dual enrollment course for business department majors. 

Data Analysis 

Data analysis for all hypothesis testing was conducted utilizing SPSS software 

version 16.0. The software system provided automated analysis of the statistical 

measures. 

To address Research Question 1, a two-factor analysis of variance was used to 

analyze for a potential difference in delivery method (online and face-to-face), potential 


40 

difference in instructor (instructors A and B), and potential interaction between the two 

factors. When the analysis of variance reveals a difference between the levels of any 

factor, Salkind (2008) referred to this as the main effect. This analysis produces three F 

statistics: to determine if a difference in grades of online students as compared to their 

classroom based counterparts was affected by a main effect for delivery, a main effect for 

instructor, and for interaction between instructor and delivery. 

Chi-square testing was selected to address research questions 2 and 3. The 

rationale for selecting chi-square testing was to observe whether a specific distribution of 

frequencies is the same as if it were to occur by chance (Salkind, 2008). If the obtained 

chi-square value is greater than the critical value, it indicates there is sufficient evidence 

to believe the research hypothesis is true. For research question 2, a chi-square test for 

differences between proportions analyzed course retention of online and face-to-face 

students at the end of semester. For Research Question 3, a chi-square test for differences 

between proportions analyzed program retention comparing students who began the 

program in the online section of TA 300 to the students who began in the face-to-face 

section. 

Limitations of the Study 

Roberts (2004) defined the limitations of the study as those features of the study 

that may affect the results of the study or the ability to generalize the results. The 

limitations of this study included (a) potential for data entry error, (b) curriculum 

modifications not reflected in the syllabi made by instructors over the period of the study, 

(c) behavior of the instructors during delivery in the two different formats, and (d) 


 
41 

rationale of students for selecting one course delivery method over another. These may 

affect the generalizability of this study to other populations. 

Summary 

This chapter described the research design, population and sample, hypotheses, 

data collection, and analysis used in this research study. Statistical analysis using two-

way analysis of variance and chi-square were used to determine if there are significant 

statistical differences in the course grades, course retention, and program retention of 

students enrolled in online classes as compared to their face-to face counterparts. The 

results of this study are presented in Chapter Four. 


 
42 

CHAPTER FOUR 

RESULTS 

The study had three main purposes. The first purpose was to determine if there 

was a difference in grades between students in online classes and students in traditional 

face-to-face classes in the Technology Administration program. In addition, the study 

was designed to examine the difference in course retention rates of students in the online 

classes as compared to the face-to-face classes. The third part of the study was designed 

to examine program retention rates of students who began the program in online classes 

and students who began the program in traditional face-to-face classes.  

This chapter begins with the descriptive statistics for the sample: gender, age, 

grades by gender, and course selection of students in online or face-to-face courses by 

gender. From the three research questions, research hypotheses were developed, and the 

results of statistical analyses used to test each hypothesis are presented.  

Descriptive Statistics 

Demographic data for the sample was collected from the student data system for 

2002 through 2009. The descriptive statistics presented below include gender (n = 884), 

age (n = 880), grades by gender (n = 884) and course selection online or face-to-face by 

gender (n = 884).  

Table 2 describes the cross-tabulation of the frequencies for gender and of the 

sample selected for the study. The mean age for the sample tested was 31.06 years, with a 

standard deviation of 9.46 years. The age range of the sample was from 18 to 66 years. 

One participant did not report gender. Age was not available for three participants.

Table 4 presents the course selection patterns of male and female students. 

Overall, more students selected online courses than face-to-face courses. Females and 

males enrolled in online courses in equal numbers; however, proportionally more females 

(68.7%) chose the online instructional format instead of face-to-face compared with 

males (60.1%).

Hypothesis Testing 

H1: There is a statistically significant difference in the course grades of students 

enrolled in online classes and students enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at the 

0.05 level of significance. The sample consisted of 815 students enrolled in online and 

face-to-face Technology Administration courses at Washburn University. A two-factor 

analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential difference in course grades due 

to delivery method (online and face-to-face), the potential difference due to instructor 

(instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the two independent 

variables.  

Mean and standard deviation for grades were calculated by delivery type and 

instructor. Table 5 presents the descriptive statistics. The mean of grades by delivery 

showed no significant difference between online and face-to-face instruction. 

Additionally, no significant difference in mean grade was evident when analyzed by 

instructor.

The results of the two-factor ANOVA, presented in Table 6, indicated there was 

no statistically significant difference in grades due to delivery method (F = 0.078, p = 

0.780, df = 1, 811). This test was specific for hypothesis 1. In addition, there was no 

statistically significant difference in grades due to instructor (F = 0.002, p = .967, df = 1, 

811), and no significant interaction between the two factors (F = 0.449, p = 0.503, df = 1, 

811). The research hypothesis was not supported.

H2: There is a statistically significant difference in student course retention 

between students enrolled in online courses and students enrolled in face-to-face courses 

at the 0.05 level of significance. The sample consisted of 885 students enrolled in TA 300 

and TA 320 online and face-to-face courses. The hypothesis testing began with the 

analysis of the contingency data presented in Table 7. The data are organized with course 

selection (online or face-to-face) as the row variable and retention in the course as the 

column variable. Data were included in the retained column if a final grade was reported 

for participant. Participants who were coded as withdraw or withdraw failing were 

labeled as not retained. Chi-square analysis was selected to observe whether a specific 

distribution of frequencies is the same as if it were to occur by chance (Roberts, 2004).  

The result of the chi square testing (X2 =  2.524, p = .112, df = 1, 884) indicated 

there was no statistically significant difference between retention of students enrolled in 

online courses compared to students enrolled in face-to-face courses in the TA program. 

Additional results indicated that 93.92% (294/313) of the online students were retained, 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to 90.89% (519/571) of the face-to-face students. The research hypothesis was 

48 

not supported.

consisted of 249 students enrolled in TA 300 in the online and face-to-face courses from 

Fall 2002 through Fall 2008. The hypothesis testing began with the analysis of the 

contingency data located in Table 8. The table is organized with course selection (online 

or face-to-face) as the row variable and program retention as the column variable. Data 

were included in the retention column if students had successfully met requirements for a 

Bachelors of Applied Science in Technology Administration or if they were enrolled in 

the program in Spring 2009. Data were included in the non-retained column if students 

had not fulfilled degree requirements and they were not enrolled in Spring 2009. Chi-

square analysis was selected to observe whether a specific distribution of frequencies is 

the same as if it were to occur by chance (Roberts, 2004).

The result of the chi-square testing (X2 = .132, p = .717, df = 1, 249) indicated 

there was no statistically significant difference between the program retention rate of 

students who began the TA program in the online courses compared to the students who 

began the program in the face-to-face courses. Additional results showed that 91.57% 

(163/178) of students who began in online courses were retained compared to 92.96% 

(66/71) of students who began the TA program in face-to-face courses. The research 

hypothesis was not supported.

Summary 

In this chapter, an introduction provided a summary of the analysis and statistical 

testing and in the order in which it was presented. This was followed by descriptive 

statistics of the sample, including age range of participants, grades by gender, and course 

selection by gender.  

Results from testing of H1 revealed no significant difference between course 

grades of online students and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes. Chi-

square testing was utilized for testing of H2. Results indicated there was no significant 


 
 
 
 
 
50 

difference in course retention of students enrolled in online courses and students enrolled 

in traditional face-to-face courses. H3 was also tested utilizing chi-square testing. The 

results indicated no significant difference in program retention of students who began the 

TA program in online courses and students who began in traditional face-to-face courses. 

Chapter Five provides a summary of the study, discussion of the findings in relationship

CHAPTER FIVE 

INTERPRETATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

Introduction 

In the preceding chapter, the results of the analysis were reported. Chapter Five 

consists of the summary of the study, an overview of the problem, purpose statement and 

research questions, review of the methodology, major findings, and findings related to the 

literature. Chapter Five also contains implications for further action and 

recommendations for further research. The purpose of the latter sections is to expand on 

the research into distance education, including implications for expansion of course and 

program delivery and future research. Finally, a summary is offered to capture the scope 

and substance of what has been offered in the research. 

Study Summary 

The online delivery of course content in higher education has increased 

dramatically in the past decade. Allen and Seaman (2007a) reported that almost 3.5 

million students participated in at least one online course during the Fall 2006 term, a 

nearly 10% increase over the number reported in the previous year. They also reported a 

9.7% increase in online enrollment compared to the 1.5% growth in overall higher 

education. As online delivery has grown, so has criticism of its efficacy. 

Online delivery of education has become an important strategy for the institution 

that is the setting of this study. The purpose of this study was three-fold. The first purpose 

of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference between the course 

grades of students participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-

based counterparts. The second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a 


52 

significant difference between course retention of students participating in TA online 

courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. A third purpose of the study 

was to determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of 

students who began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program 

enrolled in traditional face-to-face courses. The study was designed to expand the 

knowledge base concerning online education and its efficacy in providing baccalaureate 

degree completion opportunities. 

The research design was a quantitative study to compare course grades, course 

retention, and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-

face TA program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at 

Washburn University was utilized to compare online and traditional face-to-face students. 

In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of students enrolled in TA 300 and TA 

310 online and traditional face-to-face courses was analyzed. The sample included 

students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. 

Two instructors were responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-

to-face classes for the period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to 

analyze for a potential difference in the dependent variable, course grades, due to 

delivery method (online and face-to-face), the instructor (instructors A and B), and the 

potential interaction between the two independent variables (Research Question 1).  

A chi-square test for differences among proportions was used to analyze both 

course and program retention (Research Questions 2 and 3). For Research Question 2, 

archived data from the Washburn University student system was analyzed for students 

enrolled in TA 300 and TA 310. Additional variables identified for this sample included 


53 

course selection and instructor (A or B). For Research Question 3, archived data from the 

Washburn University system was used, which identified students with declared 

Technology Administration majors who began the TA program enrolled in online and 

face-to-face courses. A single gatekeeper course (TA 300) was identified for testing. Two 

instructors (A and B) were responsible for instruction during the testing period.  

A two-factor ANOVA was utilized to test H1: There is a statistically significant 

difference in course grades of students participating in online courses and students 

enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at the 0.05 level of significance. ANOVA 

testing was utilized to account for the two delivery methods and two instructors involved 

for the period of the study. The results of the test indicated there was no statistically 

significant difference in grades due to delivery method. The results of the testing also 

indicated no statistically significant difference in grades due to instructor and no 

interaction between the two independent variables. The research hypothesis was not 

supported. 

To test the next hypothesis, chi-square testing was utilized. H2: There is a 

statistically significant difference in student course retention between students 

participating in online courses and students enrolled in face-to-face courses at the 0.05 

level of significance.  The result of the chi-square testing indicated there was no 

statistically significant difference in course retention of students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in face-to-face courses in the TA program. The research 

hypothesis was not supported. 

To test the final hypothesis, chi-square testing was also used. H3: There is a 

statistically significant difference in program retention between students who begin the 


 
 
 
54 

Technology Administration program in online courses and students who begin in face-to-

face courses at the 0.05 level of significance. The result of the chi-square testing 

indicated there was no statistically significant difference in the program retention rate of 

students who began the TA program in the online courses and students who began the 

program in the face-to-face courses. The research hypothesis was not supported. Testing 

found that course retention was high in both formats, leading to interpretation that higher 

results may be due to the age of participants or prior degree completion. 

The results found no significant difference in grades, course, or program retention 

for students in online TA courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face 

instruction. The implication of these results compared to current literature is discussed in 

the next section. 

Findings Related to the Literature 

Online education has become a strategy for higher education to provide 

instruction to students limited by distance or time, or who, for other reasons, do not wish 

to attend traditional classroom-based university classes. Additionally, online education 

allows higher education institutions to expand their geographic base. Institutions have 

utilized distance education for over a century to provide instruction, but it was only 

within the last two decades that instruction over the Internet had replaced 

correspondence, television, and video courses as the method of choice for delivery 

(Russell, 1999). 

Utilizing grades as a measure of achievement, meta-analyses conducted by 

Russell (1999), Shachar and Neumann (2003), and Machtmes and Asher (2002) found no 

significant difference in grades of online students and traditional classroom-based 


 
 
55 

students. These analyses utilized multiple studies of course information, comparing 

grades of online students and traditional face-to-face students, primarily utilizing t tests 

as the preferred methodology. The results of previous research were supported by the 

present study. Additionally, this study went further, analyzing data over more than one 

semester, controlling for the effect of different instructors. These results were contrary to 

the conclusion reached by Phipps and Merisotis (1999). 

The second purpose of the study was to determine if a significant difference 

existed between the course retention of students enrolled in online TA courses and 

students enrolled in face-to-face courses. Meta-analyses conducted by Phipps and 

Merisotis (1999) and Nora and Snyder (2009) concluded a much lower course retention 

rate in online students as compared to their face-to-face counterparts. The previous meta-

analyses examined retention of online students and traditional face-to-face students in 

distinct courses, utilizing t tests as the primary methodology. The chosen method of t 

tests was used instead of the chi square testing due to the limitations of the studies to one 

course taught by one instructor, limited to one semester or cycle. Carr (2002) reported in 

The Chronicle of Higher Education that retention of online students was 50% less than 

that of traditional face-to-face students. Carrs results were based on the examination of 

longitudinal retention data from universities as reported to the United States Department 

of Education.  

The results of the present study found no significant difference in the course 

retention rates. These results are supported by the findings of Carmel and Gold (2007) in 

which they reported no significant difference in course retention rates of online students 

compared to traditional face-to-face students in their analysis of students in multiple 


 
56 

courses in disciplines across a 4-year university. The present study expanded those 

results, examining course data in the same discipline over a 6-year period and controlling 

for delivery by two separate instructors.  

Research into program completion rates of AAS students has been conducted 

primarily in traditional university settings, including Townsends (2002) studies at the 

University of Missouri-Columbia. Townsends results showed a lower baccalaureate 

completion rate for students entering with an AAS than students who transferred to 4-

year universities with an AA degree. Studies by Hogan (1997) of vocational-education 

programs also found a lower program completion rate for online students compared to 

students in traditional delivery vocational education programs. Analysis of the data in the 

current study showed no significant difference in program completion rate of students 

who began in online TA courses as compared to students who began the program in face-

to-face courses.  

Conclusions 

The use of distance education for postsecondary instruction, primarily in the form 

of the Internet, has both changed and challenged the views of traditional university-based 

instruction. Multiple studies have been designed in an effort to examine whether online 

students have the same level of academic achievement as their traditional higher 

education peers. The present study agrees with the research indicating there is no 

statistically significant difference in the grades of online students and their face-to-face 

counterparts. In addition, with student retention an issue for all postsecondary 

institutions, the data from previous studies indicated a lower retention rate for online 

students than for their traditional face-to-face classmates. The current study contradicted 


 
 
57 

those arguments. In the following sections, implications for action, recommendations for 

research, and concluding remarks are addressed.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: Implications for Action 
As postsecondary institutions move into the 21st century, many have examined 

issues of student recruitment and retention in an effort to meet the demands of both their 

students and their communities. The majority of postsecondary institutions have initiated 

online education as a strategy to recruit students from beyond their traditional geographic 

areas. This study supported existing research utilizing grades as a measure of 

achievement and should alleviate doubt that online students are shortchanged in their 

education. The transition of existing face-to-face to courses to an online delivery model 

can be accomplished without sacrificing achievement of course and program goals. 

The study also examined course and program retention data, finding no significant 

differences between online and traditional students in the TA program. The findings of 

this study support the expansion of additional online courses and programs within the

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: School of Applied Studies.  
Finally, this study can provide the basis for further action, including analyzing 

other programs and courses offered in the online format by the University. The analysis 

of other programs offered in an online delivery model would enhance further 

development of online courses and programs.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: Recommendations for Future Research 
Distance education delivery has expanded dramatically with the use of the 

Internet for online instruction. The present study could be continued in future years to 

measure the effects of specific curriculum delivery models and changes made to online 


 
 
58 

delivery platforms. In addition, the study could be expanded to include specific 

characteristics of student retention named in the literature, such as examining whether the 

age and entering GPA of students provides any insight into course and program retention. 

The study could also be expanded to include other universities with similar 

baccalaureate-degree completion programs and other disciplines. Because the body of 

research is limited concerning the baccalaureate-degree completion of students who begin 

their postsecondary education in career-oriented instruction, there is value in continuing 

to study baccalaureate completion rates, both in an online format and in more 

traditionally based settings.

CHAPTER ONE 

INTRODUCTION 

Historically, postsecondary education in the United States was founded on the 

principles of the European system, requiring the physical presence of professors and 

students in the same location (Knowles, 1994). From 1626, with the founding of Harvard 

University (The Harvard Guide, 2004), to the development of junior colleges and 

vocational schools in the early 1900s (Cohen & Brawer, 1996; Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), 

the higher education system developed to prepare post-high school students for one of 

three separate tiers. The college and university system in the United States developed its 

own set of structures designed to prepare students for baccalaureate and graduate degrees. 

Junior colleges were limited to associate degrees, while vocational education institutions 

offered occupational certificates. In many cases, there was inadequate recognition of the 

postsecondary education offered at junior colleges and vocational education institutions, 

resulting in the inability of students to transfer to 4-year institutions (National Center for 

Education Statistics, 2006).  

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges began to provide academic, 

vocational, and personal development educational offerings for members of the local 

communities. During this same period, junior or community colleges developed a role as 

transfer institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or 

distance, could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & 

Brawer, 1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs involved Associate 

of Arts (AA) and Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Associate of Applied Science 

(AAS) degrees were developed during the 1990s. The AAS degree was granted to those 


2 

who successfully completed the majority of their college program in vocational 

education. The creation of a variety of applied baccalaureate degrees allowed students 

who had previously thought of the AAS degree as a terminal program to complete a 

baccalaureate degree (Kansas Board of Regents, 2002-2003).  

Online education also became a strategy for students to access higher education in 

the 1990s (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). The proliferation of online courses alleviated some 

of the location-bound barriers to higher education, but online education was criticized as 

less rigorous than traditional classroom-based course work by traditional academicians. 

Russell attempted to address this argument with his 1999 meta-analysis of studies dating 

from the 1920s and covering multiple delivery models, including online education. 

Russell concluded there was no statistically significant difference in student achievement 

between courses offered online and those offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

Since the development of correspondence courses in the 1920s, researchers have 

attempted to ascertain if students participating in distance education are being 

shortchanged in their educational goals. No significant difference in grades has been 

found in the majority of studies designed to address this issue. Studies analyzing online 

student retention have shown significantly lower retention for online students.  In the last 

10 years, research studies have expanded to include variations of online education. These 

include strictly online, hybrid courses, Web-assisted classroom settings, and the 

traditional higher education course offered only as face-to-face instruction (Carmel & 

Gold, 2007).  

Online education continues to proliferate at the same time the number of 

secondary students in the United States overall is projected to increase (National Center 


3 

for Education Statistics [NCES], 2006). The projected increase of potential postsecondary 

students and online postsecondary options provides opportunities for increases in online 

education programs and courses. In 2000, NCES reported that over 65% of students in 

higher education were participating in online courses. In a 2007 study, Allen and Seaman 

estimated only 16% of those enrolled in online education courses are undergraduate 

students seeking their first degree, counter to the projected increase in traditional-age 

students. The majority of enrollees in online education are adults updating or advancing 

their credentials, creating an additional educational market for colleges and universities 

seeking to expand enrollment without adding physical space (Allen & Seaman, 2007a). 

For states and localities faced with a contradictory traditional-age enrollment decrease, 

these figures present an untapped market for higher education courses and programs. 

Background 

Researchers attempted to analyze the efficacy of distance education as far back as 

the 1920s when correspondence courses were created to meet the need of students not 

willing to attend a traditional classroom-based higher education setting. A meta-analysis 

of these studies resulted in The No Significant Difference Phenomenon, reported by 

Russell (2001). The results of over 355 studies were compiled, comparing various modes 

of delivery including correspondence, audio, television courses, and the newest wave of 

computer-facilitated instruction. Following analyses of studies completed prior to 2001, 

Russell concluded there was no difference in learning between students enrolled in 

distance education and those completing courses in the traditional setting.  

Studies completed since then have provided mixed results. Summers, Waigand, 

and Whittaker (2005) found there was no difference in GPA and retention between the 


4 

online and traditional classroom. Arle (2002) found higher achievement by online 

students, and Brown and Liedholm (2002) found GPA and student retention better in a 

traditional classroom setting.  

Student retention is an integral part of the student achievement conversation and 

is an issue for all forms of higher education. Degree-seeking students overall retention 

has been reported as less than 56% by NCES (2001). Long considered a problem in 

higher education, attention to the distance education model has shown even lower 

retention rates in online students than in students attending at the traditional college 

setting (Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). Research on different modalities, such as fully 

online and hybrid online courses, has produced mixed results (Carmel & Gold, 2007). No 

significant trend toward increased retention of students in any of the online modalities 

has been documented.  

Retention studies of transfer students have primarily included traditionally defined 

students transfering from a community college. Statistics have consistantly shown a 

lower retention rate for students transfering from a community college to a 4-year 

university than for students who began their post-high school education at a 4-year 

institution (NCES, 2006). Townsends studies of transfer students at the University of 

Missouri-Columbia also showed a lower baccalaureate retention rate for students who 

had completed an AAS degree than for students beginning their education at a 4-year 

institution (Townsend, 2002). 

Occupationally oriented bachelors degree completion programs are relatively 

new to higher education. Transfer programs in the liberal arts from community colleges 

to 4-year institutions were common by the 1990s. Townsend (2001), in her study 


 
5 

conducted at the University of MissouriColumbia, observed the blurring of the lines 

between non-transferrable occupationally oriented undergraduate degrees and 

undergraduate degrees and certificates that were easily transferred. The study conducted 

by Townsend was among the first to recognize that many students who began their 

education at community and technical colleges had bachelors degree aspirations that 

grew after their completion of an occupationally-oriented degree. Laanan proposed that 

the increase in institutions offering AAS degrees necessitated new ways to transfer 

undergraduate credits (2003).  

The setting of this study is a medium-sized Midwestern campus located in 

Topeka, Kansas. Washburn University enrolls approximately 6000 students a year in 

undergraduate and graduate programs, including liberal arts, professional schools, and a 

law school (Washburn University, 2008). The Technology Administration (TA) program 

selected for the present study began in the 1990s as a baccalaureate degree completion 

program for students who had received an occupationally oriented associate degree at a 

Kansas community college or through Washburns articulation agreement with Kansas 

vocational-technical schools. This program provided students who previously had 

obtained an Associate of Applied Science degree in an occupational area an opportunity 

to earn a bachelors degree. 

Peterson, Dean of Continuing Education, Washburn University, stated that in 

early 1999, Washburn University began online courses and programs at the behest of a 

neighboring community college (personal communication, April 18, 2008). Washburn 

was asked to develop an online bachelors degree completion program for students 

graduating from community colleges and technical colleges with an Associate of Applied 


6 

Science degree. The TA program was among the first programs to offer the online 

bachelors degree completion option. The TA program offered its first online courses in 

Spring 2000.  

Online education at Washburn expanded to other programs and courses, to 

include over 200 courses (Washburn University, 2008). The original online partnership 

with two community colleges expanded to include 16 additional community colleges and 

four technical colleges in Kansas, as well as colleges in Missouri, California, Wisconsin, 

South Carolina, and Nebraska (Washburn University, 2008). 

An initial study in 2002 of students course grades and retention in online courses 

offered at Washburn showed no significant difference between students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face course work (Peterson,  personal 

communication, April 18, 2008). No studies of program retention have been completed.  

In 2008, Atkins reported overall enrollment at Washburn University decreased 

6.7% from Fall 2004 to Fall 2008, from 7400 to 6901 students. During the same period, 

online course enrollment patterns increased 65%, from 3550 students to 5874 in 2007-

2008 (Washburn University, 2008). Atkins also reported that between 1998 and 2008, the 

ratio of traditional post-high school age students to nontraditional students enrolling at 

Washburn University reversed from 40:60 to 60:40. The shift in enrollment patterns 

produced an increase in enrollment in the early part of the 21st century; however, 

Washburn University anticipated a decrease in high school graduates in Kansas through 

2016, based on demographic patterns of the state. The state figures are opposite the 

anticipated increase of traditional-age students nationally (NCES, 2008). The increase in 


distance education students in relation to the anticipated decline in traditional-age 

students provided the focus for the study.

Purpose of the Study 

Online education has become an important strategy for the higher education 

institution that was the setting of this study. First, the purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between the course grades of students 

participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The 

second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference 

between course retention of students participating in TA online courses and their 

traditional classroom-based counterparts. The second part of the study was a replication 

of studies comparing modes of online course delivery to traditional classroom-based 

instruction (Carmel & Gold, 2007; Russell, 1999). A third purpose of the study was to 

determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of students who 

began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program enrolled in 

traditional face-to-face courses. The studys purpose was to expand the knowledge base 

concerning online education to include its efficacy in providing baccalaureate degree 

completion opportunities. 

Research Questions 

Roberts (2004) stated research questions guide the study and usually provide the 

structure for presenting the results of the research. The research questions guiding this 

study were: 


 
8 

1. 

Is there is a statistically significant difference between students grades in 

online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

2. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between course retention rates 

in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

3. 

Is there a statistically significant difference between program retention for 

students entering the program enrolled in online classes and students 

entering the program enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes? 

Overview of the Methodology 

A quantitative study was utilized to compare grades by course, course retention, 

and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-face TA 

program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at Washburn 

University were utilized from comparative online and traditional face-to-face classes in 

two separate courses. In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of 885 students 

enrolled in online and traditional face-to-face courses was identified. The sample 

included students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 

and 2006 in both the online and traditional face-to-face classes. Two instructors were 

responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-to-face classes for the 

period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential 

difference in the dependent variables, course grades due to delivery method (online and 

face-to-face), instructor (instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the 

two independent variables (Research Question 1). A chi-square test for differences 

among proportions was used to analyze course and program retention (Research 

Questions 2 and 3).  


 
9 

Delimitations 

Roberts (2004) defined delimitations as the boundaries of the study that are 

controlled principally by the researcher. The delimitations for this study were

online and face-to-face courses were utilized. 

2. 

The study was confined to students enrolled at Washburn University in the 

Technology Administration program. 

3. 

Only grades and retention were analyzed.

Assumptions are defined as those things presupposed in a study (Roberts, 2004). 

The study was based on the following assumptions: 

1. 

Delivery of content was consistent between online and face-to-face 

courses and instructors, 

2. 

Course objectives were the same for paired online and traditional face-to-

face courses,

CHAPTER TWO 

LITERATURE REVIEW 

This chapter presents the background for research into the efficacy of distance 

education in the delivery of higher education. Research studies have focused primarily on 

grades as a measure of the quality of distance education courses as compared to 

traditional face-to-face instruction. Utilizing grades has produced a dividing line among 

education researchers concerning the use of distance education as a delivery model. 

Retention in distance education has focused primarily on single courses, with little 

program retention data available. Data from retention studies in higher education have 

focused primarily on the traditional 4-year university student. Retention studies of 

community college students have produced quantitative results; however, these studies 

have been directed at community college students who identify themselves as transfer 

students early in their community college careers. Retention studies of students enrolled 

in occupationally oriented programs are limited. 

Statistical data of higher education shows an increased use of distance education 

for traditional academic courses as well as occupationally oriented courses. The increase 

in distance education courses and programs has provided a new dimension to studies of 

both grades and retention. The recognition of this increase, as well as questions 

concerning its impact on student learning and retention, produced the impetus for this 

study. 

The following review of the literature represents the literature related to this 

research study. Through examination of previous research, the direction of the present 

study was formulated. Specifically, the chapter is organized into four sections: (a) the 


13 

history of occupational transfer programs; (b) the history and research of distance 

education, including occupational transfer programs utilizing distance education; (c) 

research utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning in online education; and (d) 

research focusing on student retention in higher education, including student retention 

issues in transfer education and online transfer courses and programs. 

History of Occupational Transfer Programs 

The measure of success in higher education has been characterized as the 

attainment of a bachelors degree at a 4-year university. Occupationally oriented 

education was considered primarily a function of job preparation, and until the 1990s was 

not considered transferrable to other higher education institutions. Occupational transfer 

programs are a recent occurrence within the postsecondary system that provides an 

additional pathway to bachelors degree completion.  

Historically, the postsecondary experience in the United States developed as a 

three-track system. Colleges were established in the United States in 1636 with the 

founding of Harvard College (The Harvard Guide, 2004). Junior colleges were first 

founded in 1901 as experimental post-high school graduate programs (Joliet Junior 

College History, 2008). Their role was initially as a transfer institution to the university. 

When the Smith-Hughes Act was passed in 1917, a system of vocational education was 

born in the United States (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003), and was designed to provide further 

education to those students not viewed as capable of success in a university setting. 

Vocational education, currently referred to as occupational or technical education, 

was not originally designed to be a path to higher education. The first programs were 

designed to help agricultural workers complete their education and increase their skills. 


14 

More vocational programs were developed during the early 20th century as 

industrialization developed and as increasing numbers of skills were needed by workers 

in blue-collar occupations (Jacobs & Grubb, 2003). 

In the mid-20th century, some junior colleges expanded their programs beyond 

academic selections to provide occupational development and continuing education. 

Because of the geographic area from which they attracted students, junior colleges 

developed a role as community colleges. They also solidified their role as transfer 

institutions for students who, because of time, preparedness, economics, or distance, 

could not begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution (Cohen & Brawer, 

1996). Until the mid-1990s, the majority of transfer programs to 4-year universities 

involved traditional academic degrees, including the Associate of Arts (AA) and 

Associate of Science (AS) degrees. Occupational programs and continuing education 

were viewed as terminal and non-transferrable. 

In 1984, Congress authorized the Carl Perkins Vocational and Technical 

Education Act (P.L. 98-524). In the legislation, Congress responded to employers 

concerns about the lack of basic skills in employees by adding academic requirements to 

vocational education legislation. Vocational program curriculum was expanded to include 

language arts, mathematics, and science principles, and the curriculum reflected the 

context of the program. The Secretarys Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills 

(SCANS) was created in 1990 to determine the skills young people need to succeed in the 

world of work (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). In the second Carl Perkins 

reauthorization in 1990 (P.L. 105-332), Congress responded to the report, which targeted 

academic and job skills, by outlining a seamless system of vocational and academic 


15 

education to prepare vocational students to progress into and through higher education. 

This emphasis led to the development of Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees 

during the 1990s. Granted to those who have successfully completed programs in the 

applied arts and sciences for careers, AAS degrees were seen as terminal (Kansas Board 

of Regents, 2002-2003). 

But as one goal was attained, conversation turned to creating a pathway from 

occupational associate degrees to bachelors degree completion. The desire of students to 

continue from technical degrees to a baccalaureate was not a new idea. In a paper 

presented in 1989 to the American Technical Association national conference, Troutt-

Ervin and Morgans overview of 2+2 programs showed acceptance of AAS degrees at 

traditional universities was generally non-existent. Their suggestion for an academic 

bridge from early technical education to baccalaureate programs highlighted programs 

accepting AAS degrees toward baccalaureate completion were an exception rather than a 

rule (Troutt-Ervin & Morgan, 1989). It was not until the late 1990s that applied 

baccalaureate degrees recognized credits from technical degree students who had 

previously thought of themselves in a terminal program to complete their baccalaureate 

degree (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the advance of recognition of AAS degrees, standard definitions of 

transfer students continued to exclude students who completed technical programs. The 

U.S. Department of Education did not include students receiving an Associate of Applied 

Science degree in the definition of students preparing for transfer to 4-year colleges 

(Bradburn, Hurst, & Peng, 2001; Carnevale, 2006). Most states had comparable policies 

in place concerning core academic curriculum, articulation agreements, transfer of credit, 


16 

and statewide transfer guides. There was no general recognition of occupational credit 

transfer. Only a few states, including Kansas, Missouri, and Washington, allowed credits 

earned in occupationally oriented degrees to transfer to 4-year institutions (Townsend, 

2001). No state had set clear goals for the transference of occupational credits between 

institutions or for the state as a whole (Wellman, 2002).  

Despite the lack of recognition of occupational transfer credit at the federal level, 

a new definition of transfer education had emerged. Initially defined as the general 

education component of the first 2 years of a baccalaureate, the definition of transfer 

education now included any courses that transferred to a 4-year college, regardless of the 

nature of the courses (Townsend, 2001).  

The line between vocational schools, community colleges, and 4-year institutions 

blurred in the United States as employers and students increasingly made business 

decisions regarding education and workforce development. Employers increasingly asked 

for employees with academic and technical skills, as well as critical thinking skills and 

personal responsibility (U.S. Department of Labor, 2000). Returning students themselves 

were more attuned to the demands of the 21st century workforce. Their desire to return to 

higher education, coupled with the economy and the variety of options available to them, 

required a more adaptive higher education system (Carnevale, 2006). There was growing 

demand among new and returning students for higher education opportunities responsive 

to their needs. The expanding needs of the returning student provided opportunities for 

higher education to respond by utilizing different delivery models. 


 
 
17 

Distance Education 

Online education became a strategy for postsecondary institutions when the first 

correspondence courses were initiated with the mail service in the early 20th century 

(Russell, 1999). As various technologies emerged, distance education utilized television 

and video models, in addition to paper-based correspondence courses. The expansion of 

distance education utilizing computer technologies renewed academic debate over the 

efficacy of the delivery model. 

Online education utilizing the Internet became a significant factor in the 1990s, 

prompting renewed evaluation of the use of distance learning opportunities (Russell, 

1999, Phipps & Meristosis, 1999). In 19992000, the number of students who took any 

distance education courses was 8.4% of total undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary 

education (NCES, 2000). In 2000, the report of the Web-Based Education Commission to 

the President and Congress concluded that the Internet was no longer in question as a tool 

to transform the way teaching and learning was offered. The Commission recommended 

that the nation embrace E-learning as a strategy to provide on-demand, high-quality 

teaching and professional development to keep the United States competitive in the 

global workforce. They also recommended continued funding of research into teaching 

and learning utilizing web-based resources (Web-Based Education Commission, 2000). 

The acceptance of the importance of the Internet for delivery of higher education opened 

new opportunities for research and continued the academic debate of the quality of 

instruction delivered in online education courses and programs. 

In a longitudinal study from 2002-2007, The Sloan Consortium, a group of higher 

education institutions actively involved in online education, began studies of online 


18 

education in the United States over a period of 5 years. In the first study, researchers 

Allen and Seaman (2003) conducted polls of postsecondary institutions involved with 

online education and found that students overwhelming responded to the availability of 

online education, with over 1.6 million students taking at least one online course during 

the Fall semester of 2002. Over one third of these students took all of their courses 

online. The survey also found that in 2002, 81% of all institutions of higher education 

offered at least one fully online or blended course (Allen & Seaman, 2003). 

In their intermediate report in 2005, Allen and Seaman postulated that online 

education had continued to make inroads in postsecondary education, with 65% of 

schools offering graduate courses and programs face-to-face also offering graduate 

courses online. Sixty-three percent of undergraduate institutions offering face-to-face 

courses also offered courses online. From 2003 to 2005, the survey results showed that 

online education, as a long-term strategy for institutions, had increased from 49% to 56%. 

In addition, core education online course offerings had increased (Allen & Seaman, 

2005). 

In Allen and Seamans final report (2007b) for the Sloan Consortium, the 

researchers reported that almost 3.5 million students participated in at least one online 

course during the Fall 2006 term, a nearly 10% increase over the number reported in the 

previous year. Allen and Seaman also reported a 9.7% increase in online enrollment, 

compared to the 1.5% growth in overall higher education. They found by 2007, 2-year 

institutions had the highest growth rates and accounted for over the half the online 

enrollments in the previous 5 years. The researchers concluded, based on a survey 


 
 
19 

conducted as part of the research, institutions believed that improved student access was 

the top reason for offering online courses and programs (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). 

Community colleges began embracing distance education in the 1920s as part of 

their mission to provide low-cost, time-effective education. Community colleges initially 

provided correspondence courses by mail, but later switched to television and video 

courses as technology improved (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). In 2001, over 90% of public 2-

year colleges in the United States provided distance education courses over the Internet 

(NCES, 2001).  

Vocational education, by the nature of its instructional format, was among the last 

of the educational institutions to participate in distance education. Because of the 

kinesthetic nature of instruction, vocational education leaders began investigating 

distance education opportunities in the 1990s, relying on the method to provide only the 

lecture portion of instruction. By 2004, only 31% of students enrolled in vocational 

schools had participated in some form of distance education during their program of 

study (NCES, 2005). In 2008, hands-on instruction in programs such as automobile 

mechanics and welding, and the clinical portion of health occupations programs, 

continued to be taught in the traditional classroom setting (NCES, 2008). 

Analysis of data reported by the NCES indicated that distance education had 

become a staple for higher education institutions. At both the 4-year and 2-year university 

level, over 65% of institutions offered more than 12 million courses in 2006-2007 by 

distance education. While vocational education had traditionally been more hands-on, 

distance education had become more prevalent in providing opportunities for students to 

participate in components of the system over the Internet (NCES, 2008).  


 
 
 
20 

Distance education became the prevalent strategy for higher education institutions 

to expand their services to new and returning students, without the financial implications 

of capital expansion. Higher education utilized the strategy to market to students outside 

their traditional geographic reach by utilizing the power of the Internet. The increasing 

demand from students of all ages for online opportunities provided new ground for the 

expansion of higher education opportunities. 

Grades as an Indicator of Quality of Student Learning 

The grading system in the United States educational system has served as an 

indicator of knowledge for over 100 years. Educators have utilized high school grades as 

a sorting mechanism in American schools to determine postsecondary opportunities. 

Modern society has accepted honors attainment, graduation honors, and course grades as 

an indicator of knowledge acquisition in postsecondary education. Stray (2001) reported 

that the use of grading in schools can be traced to the industrial revolution and the 

development of factories.  

William Farish of Cambridge University developed the first grading system in 

higher education in 1792 (Stray, 2001). Farish mimicked the system established by 

factories of the time: grade A being the best. The thought was that Farish employed the 

grading system in order to teach more students, an aberration at that time when 

instructors rarely had more than a few. The demand for more higher education 

opportunities prompted Farish to open his class to more students, and as such, led to his 

use of a sorting system. This was the first known record of grading utilized in classrooms 

to measure student achievement (Stray, 2001). 


 
21 

Smallwood (1935) reported the first grading in higher education at Yale 

University in 1792. Stiles, President of Yale University, directed the use of the scale in 

the late 18th century. However, Smallwood noted it was not until 1813 that any record of 

grades or marking appeared. 

Using a scale of 100, philosophy and mathematic professors instituted the first use 

of a marking instrument in the 1800s at Harvard. Smallwood noted early systems were 

experimental, utilizing different numerical scales, with no standardized system in place 

between higher education institutions. It was not until the late 1800s that faculty began 

using descriptors, such as A and B, to rank students according to a predetermined 

numerical scale (Smallwood, 1935).  

Experimentation with evaluation of achievement continued into the early 20th 

century, when educational psychologists, including Dewey and Thorndike, attempted to 

compare grading scales with intelligence testing. Thorndikes philosophy of standardized 

testing and grading survived the 20th century, and his quote, Whatever exists at all exists 

in some amount (Thorndike, 1916, as cited in Ebel & Frisbie, p. 26) has been utilized in 

educational measurement textbooks as a validation of the use of standards of 

measurement to measure achievement (Ebel & Frisbie, 1991). 

The use of grades expanded to community colleges, high schools, and elementary 

schools in the early 1900s (Pressey, 1920). The use of grades throughout the educational 

system is fairly standardized today with the 4.0 scale. It is this standardization that allows 

comparison of grades as achievement between educational levels and institutions (Ebel & 

Frisbie, 1991) and allows grades to be utilized as a measure for comparison of 

educational achievement. 


22 

Researchers analyzing the success of community college transfer students have 

traditionally studied the grades of the traditional transfer student with an AA or AS 

degree. Keeley and Houses 1993 study of sophomore and junior transfer students at 

Northern Illinois University analyzed transfer shock (p. 2) for students matriculating 

from community colleges. The researchers found students who transferred from a 

community college obtained a grade point average significantly lower in their first 

semester than did students who began their college career at a 4-year institution. 

However, the results of the longitudinal studies showed that transfer students who 

persisted to graduation showed an equivalent GPA at baccalaureate completion (Keeley 

& House, 1993).  

Students who transferred from occupationally oriented degree programs typically 

were not included in traditional studies of transfer students. While the research in general 

does not include AAS students in traditional transfer data, limited conclusions were 

available comparing AAS students to traditional 4-year college attendees. Townsends 

study at the University of Missouri-Columbia (2002) showed no difference in grades at 

baccalaureate graduation between students with an AA/AS degree and students with an 

AAS degree.  

The use of grades as an indicator of the level of student achievement has been 

relied upon by studies comparing traditional classroom instruction and distance 

instruction. Research analyzing the effectiveness of student learning in distance education 

began with the first correspondence courses offered utilizing the mail service (Russell, 

1999). The study of effectiveness of correspondence courses expanded to include new 

technologies, such as television and video courses, and increased with the proliferation of 


 
23 

online educational offerings. Researchers continued to challenge the effectiveness of 

learning methods not delivered in traditional higher education settings. 

In 1991, Russell reviewed over 355 studies, dating from the 1930s and continuing 

through the late 1980s, and found no significant difference in student learning using any 

form of distance education, as compared with students in classroom-based instruction 

(Russell, 1999). Russells conclusion formed the basis for a series of works collectively 

known as No Significant Difference. Russells conclusion from his studies follows: 

The fact is the findings of comparative studies are absolutely conclusive; one can 

bank on them. No matter how it is produced, how it is delivered, whether or not it 

is interactive, low tech or high tech, students learn equally well with each 

technology and learn as well as their on-campus, face-to-face counterparts even 

though students would rather be on campus with the instructor if that were a real 

choice. (p. xviii) 

Overwhelmingly, studies have supported Russells conclusions, including 

Neuhausers (2002) study of traditional face-to-face education and online education in a 

business communications class at a large urban university in North Carolina. Neuhauser 

concluded there was no significant difference in pre- and post-test scores of students 

enrolled in online and traditional communications classes. In addition, Neuhauser found 

no significant difference in final grades, homework grades, and grades on research 

papers, even though learners in the online course were significantly older than were 

learners in the traditional face-to-face section.  

The Summers et al. (2005) research included a comparison of student 

achievement and satisfaction in an online versus a traditional face-to-face statistics class. 


24 

The study, conducted at the University of Missouri-Columbia, included undergraduate 

nursing students who were tested on both their pre- and post-course knowledge of 

statistics. Their results indicated that utilizing grades as an indicator of knowledge 

showed no significant difference between the online and traditional classroom students. 

In their meta-analysis, Machtmes and Asher (2002) reviewed 30 studies and concluded 

there did not appear to be a difference in achievement, as measured by grades, between 

distance and traditional learners. 

As technology use continued to evolve in online education, various studies were 

conducted to determine whether different delivery methods created a difference in the 

grades of online students compared to their face-to-face counterparts. A study conducted 

by Carmel and Gold (2007) supported Russells original conclusion by analyzing specific 

types of online platforms and delivery models. Carmel and Golds study included hybrid 

and traditional classroom-based instruction. They analyzed results from 164 students in 

110 courses and found no significant difference in student achievement based on grades 

between students enrolled in either delivery method.  

Additional studies supporting Russells theory have crossed multiple content 

areas and delivery models. Brown and Liedholms (2002) study at Michigan State 

University included microeconomics students in virtual, hybrid, and traditional 

classroom-based instruction. The study included 389 students in the traditional setting, 

258 in the hybrid delivery section and 89 students enrolled in online education.  No 

significant difference in student learning as measured by end of course grades was found. 

Research also showed type of course discipline is not affected by the online 

delivery model. Schulman and Simms (1999) compared pretest and posttest scores of 


25 

students enrolled in an online course and a traditional course at Nova Southeastern 

University. The researchers compared 40 undergraduate students enrolled in online 

courses and 59 undergraduate students enrolled in the classroom setting of the same 

course. Results indicated that the students who select online courses scored higher than 

traditional students scored on the pretest results. However, posttest results showed no 

significant difference for the online students versus the in-class students. Schulman and 

Simms concluded that online students were learning equally as well as their classroom-

based counterparts. Reigles (2007) analysis across disciplines at the University of San 

Francisco and the University of California found no significant difference between online 

and face-to-face student grade attainment. 

Shachar and Neumann (2003) conducted a meta-analysis that estimated and 

compared the differences between the academic performance of students enrolled in 

distance education compared to those enrolled in traditional settings over the period from 

1990-2002. Eighty-six studies containing data from over 15,000 participating students 

were included in their analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that in two-thirds 

of the cases, students taking courses by distance education outperformed their student 

counterparts enrolled in traditionally instructed courses.  

Lynch, during the use of the Tegrity system, a brand-specific online platform at 

Louisiana State University, found that students grades were slightly better after utilizing 

the technology than when the traditional approach was used (Lynch, 2002). Initial results 

of a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study of 5000 students over 2 years indicated 

that the U-Pace online students performed 12% better than their traditional Psychology 

101 counterparts on the same cumulative test (Perez, 2009). Arles (2002) study found 


26 

students enrolled in online human anatomy courses at Rio Salado College scored an 

average of 6.3% higher on assessments than the national achievement average. Students 

were assessed using a national standardized test generated by the Human Anatomy and 

Physiology Society, whose norming sample is based entirely on traditional classroom 

delivery (Arle, 2002).  

In a study conducted by Stephenson, Brown, and Griffin (2008), comparing three 

different delivery styles (traditional, asynchronous electronic courseware, and 

synchronous e-lectures), results indicated no increased effectiveness of any delivery style 

when all question types were taken into account. However, when results were analyzed, 

students receiving traditional lectures showed the lowest levels on questions designed to 

assess comprehension.  

Research found supporters in higher education academic leaders. In a 2006 survey 

of Midwestern postsecondary institutions concerning their online offerings, 56 % of 

academic leaders in the 11 states rated the learning outcomes in online education as the 

same or superior to those in face-to-face instructional settings. The proportion of higher 

education institutions believing that online learning outcomes were superior to those for 

face-to-face outcomes was still relatively small, but had grown by 34% since 2003, from 

10.2 to 13.7 % (Allen & Seaman, 2007b). This belief added merit to the conclusions 

supported by Russell and others. 

Russells (1999) no significant difference conclusion had its detractors. The 

most commonly cited is Phipps and Merisotis (1999), who reviewed Russells original 

meta-analysis (1999) and reported a much different conclusion. They concluded that the 

overall quality of the original research was questionable, that much of the research did 


27 

not control for extraneous variables, and therefore it could not show cause and effect. 

They included in their findings evidence that the studies utilized by Russell (2000) in the 

meta-analysis did not use randomly selected subjects, did not take into effect the 

differences among students, and did not include tests of validity and reliability.  

The  Phipps and Merisotis (1999) analysis included the conclusion that research 

has focused too much on individual courses rather than on academic programs, and has 

not taken into account differences among students. They postulated that based on these 

conclusions, there is a significant difference in the learning results, as evidenced by 

grades, of students participating in distance education as compared to their classroom-

based peers. Their analysis of Russells original work questioned both the quality and 

effectiveness of research comparing distance and traditional education delivery.  

While there has been ongoing conjecture that online education students are not 

receiving an equivalent learning experience compared to their traditional classroom 

counterparts, studies utilizing grades as an indicator of student learning have produced 

little evidence of the disparity. The incidence of studies showing significant negative 

differences in grades of online learners is small. Higher education institutions have 

indicated their support for online education, and its continued growth has allowed studies 

such as the present research to contribute to ongoing dialogue. 

Student Retention in Postsecondary Education 

Persistence and retention in higher education is an issue that has intrigued 

researchers for over 50 years. Quantitative studies conducted in the mid-20th century 

produced data that caused researchers to look at low retention rates in higher education 


28 

and search for answers. This question has continued to consume researchers and higher 

education institutions. 

In 1987, Tinto attempted to summarize studies of individual student retention in 

higher education by proposing a theory to allow higher education administrators to 

predict success and support students (Tinto, 1987). Tintos model of student engagement 

has been in use for over 20 years as higher education administrators and faculty attempt 

to explain student retention issues at universities and colleges. Tintos model primarily 

focused on factors of student engagement: How students respond to instructors, the 

higher education community itself, and students own engagement in learning are the 

primary factors Tinto theorized as determining the students retention. In the concluding 

remarks to his 1987 treatise on retention, Tinto acknowledged that persistence in higher 

education is but one facet of human growth and development, and one that cannot 

necessarily be attributed to a single factor or strategy. 

Tintos (1987) original study of student retention included the observation that 

student retention is a complicated web of events that shape student leaving and 

persistence. He observed that the view of student retention had changed since the 1950s, 

when students were thought to leave due to lack of motivation, persistence, and skills, 

hence the name dropout. In the 1970s, research began to focus on the role of the 

environment in student decisions to stay or leave. In the 1990s, Tinto proposed that the 

actions of the faculty were the key to institutional efforts to enhance student retention 

(Tinto, 2007). This was a significant addition to his theory, placing the cause on the 

instructor instead of the student, and it has done much to influence retention strategies 


29 

utilized in higher education institutions (Tinto, 2007). Tintos studies have driven 

research in both traditional retention studies and those involving distance education.  

Studies of the persistence of the postsecondary student routinely focus on 4-year 

postsecondary education. It is only within the last 20 years that persistence studies have 

included community college students and occupational students, acknowledging that their 

reasons for entering the postsecondary community are different from the traditional 4-

year higher education participant (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). With different avenues to a 

baccalaureate degree more prevalent, the research into college persistence has expanded 

to include other types of programs and students. 

Postsecondary student retention rates routinely utilize data from longitudinal 

studies of students entering in a Fall semester and completing a bachelors program no 

more than 6 years later (NCES, 2003). The National Center for Education Statistics 

reported that 55% of those seeking a baccalaureate degree would complete in 6 years 

(NCES, 2003). The report acknowledged institutions are unable to follow students who 

transfer to other institutions; they are able to report only the absence of enrollment in 

their own institution.  

Research has also found a large gap between community college entrants and 4-

year college entrants in rates of attaining a bachelors degree. Dougherty (1992) reported 

that students entering community college receive 11 to 19% fewer bachelors degrees 

than students beginning at a 4-year university. Dougherty postulated that the lower 

baccalaureate attainment rate of community college entrants was attributable to both their 

individual traits and the institution they entered (Dougherty, 1992). 


30 

Studies of student retention of community college also vary based on the types of 

students. Community college retention rates are routinely reported as lower than 

traditional 4-year institutions (NCES, 2007). Cohen and Brawer (1996) attributed the 

differences in retention to the difference in the mission. In many instances, students did 

not enroll in a community college in order to attain a degree (Cohen & Brawer, 1996). 

The most recent longitudinal study in 1993 showed a retention rate of 55.4% of students 

after 3 years (NCES, 2001).  

Of community college students, only 60.9% indicated a desire to transfer later to a 

baccalaureate degree completion program (NCES, 2003). While retention data collected 

by the federal government (NCES, 2003) did not include students with an AAS degree, 

Townsends studies of the transfer rates and baccalaureate attainment rates of students in 

Missouri who had completed an Associate of Arts and students who had completed an 

Associate of Applied Science degree was 61% compared to 54% (Townsend, 2001).  

Vocational or occupational programs have reported retention rates as program 

completion, a definition involving completion of specific tasks and competencies 

instead of grades and tied to a limited program length. This state and federal requirement 

indicates program quality and ensures continued federal funding. In 2001, the U.S. 

Department of Education reported a 60.1% completion rate of postsecondary students 

enrolled in occupational education (NCES, 2007). Until 1995, the reasons for students 

leaving was neither delineated nor reported; it was not until federal reporting 

requirements under the Carl Perkins Act of 1994 that institutions were required to explore 

why students were not retained in vocational programs (P.L. 105-332). 


31 

Distance education provided a new arena for the study of student persistence. 

Theorists and researchers have attempted to utilize Tintos model of student persistence 

to explain retention issues involved with distance education. However, Rovai (2003) 

analyzed the differing student characteristics of distance learners as compared to the 

traditional students targeted by Tintos original models and concluded that student 

retention theories proposed from that population were no longer applicable to distance 

education learners. Rovai proposed that distance educators could address retention in 

ways that traditional higher education has not. He suggested that distance educators 

utilize strategies such as capitalizing on students expectations of technology, addressing 

economic benefits and specific educational needs to increase student retention in courses 

(Rovai, 2003). 

The expanded use of technology created a distinct subset of research into student 

retention issues. In 2004, Berge and Huang developed an overview of models of student 

retention, with special emphasis on models developed to explain the retention rates in 

distance education. Their studies primarily focused on the variables in student 

demographics and external factors, such as age and gender, which influence persistence 

and retention in online learning. Berge and Huang found that traditional models of 

student retention such as Tintos did not acknowledge the differences in student 

expectations and goals that are ingrained in the students selection of the online learning 

option. 

Other researchers have attempted to study retention issues specifically for online 

education. In a meta-analysis, Nora and Snyder (2009) found the majority of studies of 

online education focused on students individual characteristics and individual 


32 

perceptions of technology. Nora and Snyder concluded that researchers attempt to utilize 

traditional models of student engagement to explain student retention issues in distance or 

online learning courses, with little or no success. This supported Berge and Huards 

conclusions. Nora and Snyder (2009) also noted a dearth of quantitative research.  

Few quantitative studies exist that support higher or equal retention in online 

students compared to their classroom-based counterparts. One example is the Carmel and 

Gold (2007) study. They found no significant difference in student retention rates 

between students in distance education courses and their traditional classroom-based 

counterparts. The study utilized data from 164 students, 95 enrolled in classroom-based 

courses and 69 enrolled in a hybrid online format. Participants randomly self-selected and 

were not all enrolled in the same course, introducing variables not attributed in the study.  

The majority of quantitative studies instead concluded there is a higher retention 

rate in traditional classrooms than in distance education. In the Phipps and Merisotis 

(1999) review of Russells original research, which included online education, results 

indicated that research has shown even lower retention rates in online students than in 

students attending classes in the traditional college setting. The high dropout rate among 

distance education students was not addressed in Russells meta-analysis, and Phipps and 

Merisotis found no suitable explanation in the research. They postulated that the 

decreased retention rate documented within distance education studies skews 

achievement data by excluding the dropouts. 

Diaz (2002) found a high drop rate for online students compared to traditional 

classroom-based students in an online health education course at Nova Southeastern. 

Other studies have supported the theory that retention of online students is far below that 


33 

of the traditional campus students. In 2002, Carr, reporting for The Chronicle of Higher 

Education, noted that online courses routinely lose 50 % of students who originally 

enrolled, as compared to a retention rate of 70-75% of traditional face-to-face students. 

Carr reported dropout rates of up to 75% in online courses as a likely indicator of the 

difficultly faced in retaining distance education students who do not routinely meet with 

faculty. The data have not been refuted. 

As community colleges began utilizing distance education, retention rates were 

reported as higher than traditional students (Nash, 1984). However, the California 

Community College System report for Fall 2008 courses showed inconsistent retention 

results for distance education learners, varying by the type of course. Results indicated 

equivalent retention rates for online instruction compared to traditional coursework in the 

majority of courses. Lower retention rates were indicated in online engineering, social 

sciences, and mathematics courses as compared to traditional classroom instructional 

models (California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, 2009). 

Due to the limited number of vocational/technical or occupational courses taught 

in the online mode, there was little data on student retention. In 1997, Hogan studied 

technical course and program completion of students in distance and traditional 

vocational education and found that course completion rates were higher for distance 

education students. However, program completion rates were higher for traditional 

students than for students enrolled in distance education (Hogan, 1997).  

In summary, studies of retention have focused primarily on student characteristics 

while acknowledging that postsecondary retention rates vary according to a variety of 

factors. Research showed mixed results concerning the retention rate of online students, 


34 

though quantitative data leans heavily toward a lower course retention rate in online 

students. Data from 4-year universities have shown lower retention rates for online 

students than for traditional face-to-face students, while community colleges have shown 

inconsistent results. Data from vocational-technical education has been limited, but 

course retention rates are higher for online students, while program retention rates are 

lower. No significant research factor affecting retention has been isolated between 

students in online baccalaureate completion programs and students participating in 

traditional classroom-based settings. 

Summary 

Research studies have been conducted analyzing student retention in higher 

education, transfer and retention of students from community colleges to universities, the 

impact of distance education, and student achievement and retention factors related to 

distance education. However, no comparative research was identified that compared the 

achievement and retention of students participating in an occupationally oriented transfer 

program utilizing both online education and traditional classroom-based instruction. 

Chapter Three addresses the topics of research design, hypotheses, and research 

questions. Additionally, population and sample, data collection, and data analysis are 

discussed.

CHAPTER THREE 

METHODOLOGY 

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a significant difference 

between course grades of students enrolled in online Technology Administration courses 

and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. The study also examined if there is a 

significant difference between course retention and program retention of students 

enrolled in online Technology Administration courses and their traditional classroom-

based counterparts. The methodology employed to test the research hypotheses is 

presented in this chapter. The chapter is organized into the following sections: research 

design, hypotheses and research questions, population and sample, data collection, data 

analysis, and summary. 

Research Design 

A quantitative, quasi-experimental research design was selected to study grades, 

course retention, and program retention in students enrolled in the Technology 

Administration program. The design was chosen as a means to determine if significant 

differences occur between online and face-to-face students by examining numerical 

scores from all participants enrolled, and retention rates in both courses and programs in 

the Technology Administration program.  

Hypotheses and Research Questions 

This study focused on three research questions with accompanying hypotheses. 

The research questions and hypotheses guiding the study follow. 


 
 
36 

Research Question 1: Is there is a statistically significant difference between 

students grades in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes? 

H1: There is a statistically significant difference in course grades of students 

participating in online courses and students enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at 

the 0.05 level of significance.  

Research Question 2: Is there a statistically significant difference between course 

retention rate of students in online classes and traditional face-to-face classes?  

H2: There is a statistically significant difference in student course retention 

between students participating in online courses and students enrolled in face-to-face 

courses at the 0.05 level of significance.  

Research Question 3: Is there a statistically significant difference in program 

retention between students who entered the program in online classes and students who 

entered the program in traditional face-to-face classes? 

H3: There is a statistically significant difference in program retention between 

students who begin the Technology Administration program in online courses and 

students who begin in face-to-face courses at the 0.05 level of significance. 

Population and Sample 

The two populations selected were students enrolled in online and face-to-face 

courses. The sample included students enrolled in Technology Administration courses. 

Student enrollment was analyzed for all Technology Administration courses in the 

program sequence to determine the number of samples available in online and face-to-

face classes. The course enrollment data for the sample are outlined in Table E1. The 

subsample of the data utilized for the study is presented in Table 1.

Note: TA 300 Evolution and Development of Technology, TA 310 Technology and Society 

The subsample for hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 included all students enrolled in 

two entry-level courses required for completion of the Technology Administration 

program: TA 300 Evolution and Development of Technology, and TA 310 Society and

Technology. The university offered the courses in online and face-to-face formats during 

the period of the study. Two instructors, identified as A and B, were involved with 

teaching the online and face-to-face courses. Two courses were selected that met the 

following criteria: (a) the same faculty member taught both courses, (b) the courses were 

offered over the period of the study consistently in online and face-to-face instruction, 

and (c) the syllabi for simultaneous online and face-to-face sections were identical. 

For hypothesis 3, data included records of all students enrolled in TA 300 

Evolution and Development of Technology for the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 

2005, and 2006. The course was selected for inclusion in the study based on the 

following criteria: (a) student enrollment in the course was the result of declaration of the 

Technology Administration program major and (b) parameters of the study allowed 

students 2 or more years to complete the program requirements. For the purpose of the 

study, all student names were removed. 

Data Collection 

An Institutional Review Board (IRB) form was prepared for Washburn University 

approval prior to data collection. The study was designated as an exempt study. The 

Washburn University IRB form is provided in Appendix A. Approval of the IRB was 

transmitted by e-mail. A copy is located in Appendix B. In addition, an IRB was

approval letter is located in Appendix D. 

Washburn University had two types of data collection systems in place during the 

period identified for the study, Spring 2002 through Spring 2008. The AS 400 data 

collection system generated paper reports for 2002 and 2003. The researcher was allowed 


 
39 

access to paper records for 2002 and 2003. Enrollment results for all technology 

administration sections for 2002-2003 were entered manually into an Excel spreadsheet.  

In 2004, the University transferred to the Banner electronic student data 

management system. All records since 2004 were archived electronically and were 

retrieved utilizing the following filters for data specific to students enrolled in the 

identified Technology Administration courses: TA course designation and specific 

coding for year and semester to be analyzed (01 = Spring semester, 03 = Fall semester, 

200X for specified year). Results retrieved under the Banner system were saved as an 

Excel spreadsheet by the researcher. The course enrollment data for the sample are 

presented in Tables E1 and E2. 

Student transcripts and records were analyzed to determine program completion 

or continued enrollment in the program for program retention analysis. Documents 

examined included paper student advising files located within the Technology 

Administration department and specific student records housed within the Banner 

reporting system. Technology Administration course TA 300 was selected based on the 

following: (a) It is a required entry course only for Technology Administration majors, 

and (b) TA 310 is a dual enrollment course for business department majors. 

Data Analysis 

Data analysis for all hypothesis testing was conducted utilizing SPSS software 

version 16.0. The software system provided automated analysis of the statistical 

measures. 

To address Research Question 1, a two-factor analysis of variance was used to 

analyze for a potential difference in delivery method (online and face-to-face), potential 


40 

difference in instructor (instructors A and B), and potential interaction between the two 

factors. When the analysis of variance reveals a difference between the levels of any 

factor, Salkind (2008) referred to this as the main effect. This analysis produces three F 

statistics: to determine if a difference in grades of online students as compared to their 

classroom based counterparts was affected by a main effect for delivery, a main effect for 

instructor, and for interaction between instructor and delivery. 

Chi-square testing was selected to address research questions 2 and 3. The 

rationale for selecting chi-square testing was to observe whether a specific distribution of 

frequencies is the same as if it were to occur by chance (Salkind, 2008). If the obtained 

chi-square value is greater than the critical value, it indicates there is sufficient evidence 

to believe the research hypothesis is true. For research question 2, a chi-square test for 

differences between proportions analyzed course retention of online and face-to-face 

students at the end of semester. For Research Question 3, a chi-square test for differences 

between proportions analyzed program retention comparing students who began the 

program in the online section of TA 300 to the students who began in the face-to-face 

section. 

Limitations of the Study 

Roberts (2004) defined the limitations of the study as those features of the study 

that may affect the results of the study or the ability to generalize the results. The 

limitations of this study included (a) potential for data entry error, (b) curriculum 

modifications not reflected in the syllabi made by instructors over the period of the study, 

(c) behavior of the instructors during delivery in the two different formats, and (d) 


 
41 

rationale of students for selecting one course delivery method over another. These may 

affect the generalizability of this study to other populations. 

Summary 

This chapter described the research design, population and sample, hypotheses, 

data collection, and analysis used in this research study. Statistical analysis using two-

way analysis of variance and chi-square were used to determine if there are significant 

statistical differences in the course grades, course retention, and program retention of 

students enrolled in online classes as compared to their face-to face counterparts. The 

results of this study are presented in Chapter Four.

CHAPTER FOUR 

RESULTS 

The study had three main purposes. The first purpose was to determine if there 

was a difference in grades between students in online classes and students in traditional 

face-to-face classes in the Technology Administration program. In addition, the study 

was designed to examine the difference in course retention rates of students in the online 

classes as compared to the face-to-face classes. The third part of the study was designed 

to examine program retention rates of students who began the program in online classes 

and students who began the program in traditional face-to-face classes.  

This chapter begins with the descriptive statistics for the sample: gender, age, 

grades by gender, and course selection of students in online or face-to-face courses by 

gender. From the three research questions, research hypotheses were developed, and the 

results of statistical analyses used to test each hypothesis are presented.  

Descriptive Statistics 

Demographic data for the sample was collected from the student data system for 

2002 through 2009. The descriptive statistics presented below include gender (n = 884), 

age (n = 880), grades by gender (n = 884) and course selection online or face-to-face by 

gender (n = 884).  

Table 2 describes the cross-tabulation of the frequencies for gender and of the 

sample selected for the study. The mean age for the sample tested was 31.06 years, with a 

standard deviation of 9.46 years. The age range of the sample was from 18 to 66 years. 

One participant did not report gender. Age was not available for three participants.

Table 4 presents the course selection patterns of male and female students. 

Overall, more students selected online courses than face-to-face courses. Females and 

males enrolled in online courses in equal numbers; however, proportionally more females 

(68.7%) chose the online instructional format instead of face-to-face compared with 

males (60.1%).

Hypothesis Testing 

H1: There is a statistically significant difference in the course grades of students 

enrolled in online classes and students enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at the 

0.05 level of significance. The sample consisted of 815 students enrolled in online and 

face-to-face Technology Administration courses at Washburn University. A two-factor 

analysis of variance was used to analyze for the potential difference in course grades due 

to delivery method (online and face-to-face), the potential difference due to instructor 

(instructors A and B), and the potential interaction between the two independent 

variables.  

Mean and standard deviation for grades were calculated by delivery type and 

instructor. Table 5 presents the descriptive statistics. The mean of grades by delivery 

showed no significant difference between online and face-to-face instruction. 

Additionally, no significant difference in mean grade was evident when analyzed by 

instructor.

The results of the two-factor ANOVA, presented in Table 6, indicated there was 

no statistically significant difference in grades due to delivery method (F = 0.078, p = 

0.780, df = 1, 811). This test was specific for hypothesis 1. In addition, there was no 

statistically significant difference in grades due to instructor (F = 0.002, p = .967, df = 1, 

811), and no significant interaction between the two factors (F = 0.449, p = 0.503, df = 1, 

811). The research hypothesis was not supported.

H2: There is a statistically significant difference in student course retention 

between students enrolled in online courses and students enrolled in face-to-face courses 

at the 0.05 level of significance. The sample consisted of 885 students enrolled in TA 300 

and TA 320 online and face-to-face courses. The hypothesis testing began with the 

analysis of the contingency data presented in Table 7. The data are organized with course 

selection (online or face-to-face) as the row variable and retention in the course as the 

column variable. Data were included in the retained column if a final grade was reported 

for participant. Participants who were coded as withdraw or withdraw failing were 

labeled as not retained. Chi-square analysis was selected to observe whether a specific 

distribution of frequencies is the same as if it were to occur by chance (Roberts, 2004).  

The result of the chi square testing (X2 =  2.524, p = .112, df = 1, 884) indicated 

there was no statistically significant difference between retention of students enrolled in 

online courses compared to students enrolled in face-to-face courses in the TA program. 

Additional results indicated that 93.92% (294/313) of the online students were retained, 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to 90.89% (519/571) of the face-to-face students. The research hypothesis was 

48 

not supported.

H3: There is a statistically significant difference in program retention between 

students who begin the Technology Administration program in online courses and 

students who begin in face-to-face courses at the 0.05 level of significance. The sample 

consisted of 249 students enrolled in TA 300 in the online and face-to-face courses from 

Fall 2002 through Fall 2008. The hypothesis testing began with the analysis of the 

contingency data located in Table 8. The table is organized with course selection (online 

or face-to-face) as the row variable and program retention as the column variable. Data 

were included in the retention column if students had successfully met requirements for a 

Bachelors of Applied Science in Technology Administration or if they were enrolled in 

the program in Spring 2009. Data were included in the non-retained column if students 

had not fulfilled degree requirements and they were not enrolled in Spring 2009. Chi-

square analysis was selected to observe whether a specific distribution of frequencies is 

the same as if it were to occur by chance (Roberts, 2004).  


 
 
 
 
 
49 

The result of the chi-square testing (X2 = .132, p = .717, df = 1, 249) indicated 

there was no statistically significant difference between the program retention rate of 

students who began the TA program in the online courses compared to the students who 

began the program in the face-to-face courses. Additional results showed that 91.57% 

(163/178) of students who began in online courses were retained compared to 92.96% 

(66/71) of students who began the TA program in face-to-face courses. The research 

hypothesis was not supported.

Summary 

In this chapter, an introduction provided a summary of the analysis and statistical 

testing and in the order in which it was presented. This was followed by descriptive 

statistics of the sample, including age range of participants, grades by gender, and course 

selection by gender.  

Results from testing of H1 revealed no significant difference between course 

grades of online students and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face classes. Chi-

square testing was utilized for testing of H2. Results indicated there was no significant 


 
 
 
 
 
50 

difference in course retention of students enrolled in online courses and students enrolled 

in traditional face-to-face courses. H3 was also tested utilizing chi-square testing. The 

results indicated no significant difference in program retention of students who began the 

TA program in online courses and students who began in traditional face-to-face courses. 

Chapter Five provides a summary of the study, discussion of the findings in relationship 

to the literature, implications for practice, recommendations for further research, and

CHAPTER FIVE 

INTERPRETATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

Introduction 

In the preceding chapter, the results of the analysis were reported. Chapter Five 

consists of the summary of the study, an overview of the problem, purpose statement and 

research questions, review of the methodology, major findings, and findings related to the 

literature. Chapter Five also contains implications for further action and 

recommendations for further research. The purpose of the latter sections is to expand on 

the research into distance education, including implications for expansion of course and 

program delivery and future research. Finally, a summary is offered to capture the scope 

and substance of what has been offered in the research. 

Study Summary 

The online delivery of course content in higher education has increased 

dramatically in the past decade. Allen and Seaman (2007a) reported that almost 3.5 

million students participated in at least one online course during the Fall 2006 term, a 

nearly 10% increase over the number reported in the previous year. They also reported a 

9.7% increase in online enrollment compared to the 1.5% growth in overall higher 

education. As online delivery has grown, so has criticism of its efficacy. 

Online delivery of education has become an important strategy for the institution 

that is the setting of this study. The purpose of this study was three-fold. The first purpose 

of the study was to determine if there was a significant difference between the course 

grades of students participating in TA online courses and their traditional classroom-

based counterparts. The second purpose of the study was to determine if there was a 


52 

significant difference between course retention of students participating in TA online 

courses and their traditional classroom-based counterparts. A third purpose of the study 

was to determine if there was a significant difference between program retention of 

students who began the TA program in online courses and those who began the program 

enrolled in traditional face-to-face courses. The study was designed to expand the 

knowledge base concerning online education and its efficacy in providing baccalaureate 

degree completion opportunities. 

The research design was a quantitative study to compare course grades, course 

retention, and program retention of students enrolled in the online and traditional face-to-

face TA program at Washburn University. Archival data from the student system at 

Washburn University was utilized to compare online and traditional face-to-face students. 

In order to answer Research Question 1, a sample of students enrolled in TA 300 and TA 

310 online and traditional face-to-face courses was analyzed. The sample included 

students entering the program in the Fall semesters of 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. 

Two instructors were responsible for concurrent instruction of both the online and face-

to-face classes for the period analyzed. A two-factor analysis of variance was used to 

analyze for a potential difference in the dependent variable, course grades, due to 

delivery method (online and face-to-face), the instructor (instructors A and B), and the 

potential interaction between the two independent variables (Research Question 1).  

A chi-square test for differences among proportions was used to analyze both 

course and program retention (Research Questions 2 and 3). For Research Question 2, 

archived data from the Washburn University student system was analyzed for students 

enrolled in TA 300 and TA 310. Additional variables identified for this sample included 


53 

course selection and instructor (A or B). For Research Question 3, archived data from the 

Washburn University system was used, which identified students with declared 

Technology Administration majors who began the TA program enrolled in online and 

face-to-face courses. A single gatekeeper course (TA 300) was identified for testing. Two 

instructors (A and B) were responsible for instruction during the testing period.  

A two-factor ANOVA was utilized to test H1: There is a statistically significant 

difference in course grades of students participating in online courses and students 

enrolled in a traditional classroom setting at the 0.05 level of significance. ANOVA 

testing was utilized to account for the two delivery methods and two instructors involved 

for the period of the study. The results of the test indicated there was no statistically 

significant difference in grades due to delivery method. The results of the testing also 

indicated no statistically significant difference in grades due to instructor and no 

interaction between the two independent variables. The research hypothesis was not 

supported. 

To test the next hypothesis, chi-square testing was utilized. H2: There is a 

statistically significant difference in student course retention between students 

participating in online courses and students enrolled in face-to-face courses at the 0.05 

level of significance.  The result of the chi-square testing indicated there was no 

statistically significant difference in course retention of students enrolled in online 

courses and students enrolled in face-to-face courses in the TA program. The research 

hypothesis was not supported. 

To test the final hypothesis, chi-square testing was also used. H3: There is a 

statistically significant difference in program retention between students who begin the 


 
 
 
54 

Technology Administration program in online courses and students who begin in face-to-

face courses at the 0.05 level of significance. The result of the chi-square testing 

indicated there was no statistically significant difference in the program retention rate of 

students who began the TA program in the online courses and students who began the 

program in the face-to-face courses. The research hypothesis was not supported. Testing 

found that course retention was high in both formats, leading to interpretation that higher 

results may be due to the age of participants or prior degree completion. 

The results found no significant difference in grades, course, or program retention 

for students in online TA courses and students enrolled in traditional face-to-face 

instruction. The implication of these results compared to current literature is discussed in 

the next section. 

Findings Related to the Literature 

Online education has become a strategy for higher education to provide 

instruction to students limited by distance or time, or who, for other reasons, do not wish 

to attend traditional classroom-based university classes. Additionally, online education 

allows higher education institutions to expand their geographic base. Institutions have 

utilized distance education for over a century to provide instruction, but it was only 

within the last two decades that instruction over the Internet had replaced 

correspondence, television, and video courses as the method of choice for delivery 

(Russell, 1999). 

Utilizing grades as a measure of achievement, meta-analyses conducted by 

Russell (1999), Shachar and Neumann (2003), and Machtmes and Asher (2002) found no 

significant difference in grades of online students and traditional classroom-based 


 
 
55 

students. These analyses utilized multiple studies of course information, comparing 

grades of online students and traditional face-to-face students, primarily utilizing t tests 

as the preferred methodology. The results of previous research were supported by the 

present study. Additionally, this study went further, analyzing data over more than one 

semester, controlling for the effect of different instructors. These results were contrary to 

the conclusion reached by Phipps and Merisotis (1999). 

The second purpose of the study was to determine if a significant difference 

existed between the course retention of students enrolled in online TA courses and 

students enrolled in face-to-face courses. Meta-analyses conducted by Phipps and 

Merisotis (1999) and Nora and Snyder (2009) concluded a much lower course retention 

rate in online students as compared to their face-to-face counterparts. The previous meta-

analyses examined retention of online students and traditional face-to-face students in 

distinct courses, utilizing t tests as the primary methodology. The chosen method of t 

tests was used instead of the chi square testing due to the limitations of the studies to one 

course taught by one instructor, limited to one semester or cycle. Carr (2002) reported in 

The Chronicle of Higher Education that retention of online students was 50% less than 

that of traditional face-to-face students. Carrs results were based on the examination of 

longitudinal retention data from universities as reported to the United States Department 

of Education.  

The results of the present study found no significant difference in the course 

retention rates. These results are supported by the findings of Carmel and Gold (2007) in 

which they reported no significant difference in course retention rates of online students 

compared to traditional face-to-face students in their analysis of students in multiple 


 
56 

courses in disciplines across a 4-year university. The present study expanded those 

results, examining course data in the same discipline over a 6-year period and controlling 

for delivery by two separate instructors.  

Research into program completion rates of AAS students has been conducted 

primarily in traditional university settings, including Townsends (2002) studies at the 

University of Missouri-Columbia. Townsends results showed a lower baccalaureate 

completion rate for students entering with an AAS than students who transferred to 4-

year universities with an AA degree. Studies by Hogan (1997) of vocational-education 

programs also found a lower program completion rate for online students compared to 

students in traditional delivery vocational education programs. Analysis of the data in the 

current study showed no significant difference in program completion rate of students 

who began in online TA courses as compared to students who began the program in face-

to-face courses.  

Conclusions 

The use of distance education for postsecondary instruction, primarily in the form 

of the Internet, has both changed and challenged the views of traditional university-based 

instruction. Multiple studies have been designed in an effort to examine whether online 

students have the same level of academic achievement as their traditional higher 

education peers. The present study agrees with the research indicating there is no 

statistically significant difference in the grades of online students and their face-to-face 

counterparts. In addition, with student retention an issue for all postsecondary 

institutions, the data from previous studies indicated a lower retention rate for online 

students than for their traditional face-to-face classmates. The current study contradicted 


 
 
57 

those arguments. In the following sections, implications for action, recommendations for 

research, and concluding remarks are addressed. 

Implications for Action 

As postsecondary institutions move into the 21st century, many have examined 

issues of student recruitment and retention in an effort to meet the demands of both their 

students and their communities. The majority of postsecondary institutions have initiated 

online education as a strategy to recruit students from beyond their traditional geographic 

areas. This study supported existing research utilizing grades as a measure of 

achievement and should alleviate doubt that online students are shortchanged in their 

education. The transition of existing face-to-face to courses to an online delivery model 

can be accomplished without sacrificing achievement of course and program goals. 

The study also examined course and program retention data, finding no significant 

differences between online and traditional students in the TA program. The findings of 

this study support the expansion of additional online courses and programs within the 

School of Applied Studies.  

Finally, this study can provide the basis for further action, including analyzing 

other programs and courses offered in the online format by the University. The analysis 

of other programs offered in an online delivery model would enhance further 

development of online courses and programs. 

Recommendations for Future Research 

Distance education delivery has expanded dramatically with the use of the 

Internet for online instruction. The present study could be continued in future years to 

measure the effects of specific curriculum delivery models and changes made to online 


 
 
58 

delivery platforms. In addition, the study could be expanded to include specific 

characteristics of student retention named in the literature, such as examining whether the 

age and entering GPA of students provides any insight into course and program retention. 

The study could also be expanded to include other universities with similar 

baccalaureate-degree completion programs and other disciplines. Because the body of 

research is limited concerning the baccalaureate-degree completion of students who begin 

their postsecondary education in career-oriented instruction, there is value in continuing 

to study baccalaureate completion rates, both in an online format and in more 

traditionally based settings. 

Concluding Remarks 

The current study examined a Technology Administration program that has been 

offered in both online and face-to-face format, utilizing data from Fall 2002 through 

Spring 2008. The TA program was developed to allow students who had completed an 

occupationally oriented AAS degree to complete a bachelors degree program. Three 

hypotheses were tested in this study, examining course grades, course retention, and 

program retention of students enrolled in online and face-to-face courses in Technology 

Administration. No significant difference was found for the three hypotheses.  

These results form a strong foundation for expanding online courses and 

programs at Washburn University. By addressing two of the major concerns of educators, 

achievement and retention, the study results allow expansion of online courses and 

programs to benefit from data-driven decision-making. Other institutions can and should 

utilize data to examine existing online course and program data.

Title: A revolution in biochemistry and molecular biology, PDF: Research_papers_50\PIIS0021925817501040.pdf
Header: Establishing the foundation
For many biochemists and molecular cell biologists, the
foundations driving interests in biology were immediately
experiential. Most young children watch seeds sprout, plant a
small garden, or conduct the celery experiment with colored
water; some may make a pH indicator from purple cabbage or
help deliver a calf or a litter of puppies. With such experiences,
I always had questions about natural thingsmostly biology,
many not immediately answeredand thus required a visit to
the local library or taking a dusty college book off the shelf in

the living room. By middle school, interests grew, and learning
about and drawing atomic orbitals was nothing short of fantas-
tic. The subsequent foundations in math, chemistry, physics,
and biology in high school were routine and lacked the excite-
ment from earlier instructors with one exception. As a senior
and taking now what would be called AP Biology or AP Chem-
istry, there was immersion with hands-on activities that
included everything from pH curves and enzyme assays to ani-
mal dissections coupled with active discussions by teams of stu-
dents of how and why. This was the foundation that established
interests, thus setting the stage for my decisions and programs
of study in college.

As an undergraduate student in the mid-1970s, I immedi-
ately realized that basic research was fundamental in driving
education in biochemistry and cell and molecular biology. The
journal Cell had been established in 1974 and, along with more
established journals including the Journal of Biological Chemis-
try, Journal of Cell Biology, and Biochemistry, served as a plat-
form linking cutting-edge research with teaching a sophomore-
level cell biology course and extending to biochemistry and
biophysical chemistry in subsequent years. The use of primary
literature, while tough, provided real-time information that
was being integrated into foundational concepts. As so, follow-
ing my sophomore year, it was time to join a research labora-
tory, which was initially daunting, yet in time, an independent
research project was developed that along with a rigorous
course of study in biology and chemistry was foundational for
advanced studies.

Graduate school offered the opportunity to deploy many of
the same strategies using primary literature while teaching cell
and molecular biology laboratory and learning the value of
teamwork. There was an immediate realization that ones pas-
sion for cutting-edge science was not universal, and thus it was
essential to develop strategies demonstrating how the use of a
research article in a laboratory setting was approachable. It
became important to ask: How do you teach a sophomore to
read a primary research paper? Where does data come from,
and how can it be interpreted? How can a team be more effec-
tive that a single individual in addressing a specific question?
And how does that data yield new information to drive the field
forward? What came from this two-year period was a basic
understanding of balancing the need to understand a concept
and coupling that information with cutting-edge research to
further advance that concept.

ASBMB AWARD ARTICLE: 21st century biochemistry and molecular biology education

One of the highlights of being a postdoctoral research fellow
in the early 1980s was working with undergraduate students
with a keen interest in biochemistry and molecular biology. My
research was addressing the mechanistic basis of fatty acid
transport and linkages to fatty acid activation and oxidation in
Escherichia coli. It was during this period that the real impor-
tance of teamwork in science at the bench became apparent
and that undergraduate students were effective members of a
team given the proper mentoring. The undergraduate students
were involved in key aspects of the work that included cloning
the gene required for fatty acid transport (fadL), defining both
patterns of complementation and expression, and culminating
with purifying the protein FadL and showing that it was local-
ized to the outer membrane. Three of the five papers published
as a postdoc included undergraduate authors (13).

These foundations are not unique, as most scientists have
comparable experiences. They did however, guide my passion
to link research with teaching and learning with the firm belief
that biochemistry and molecular biology education is informed
by basic research. These linkages are coincident with science
(and, more broadly, STEM) education research addressing the
importance of asking questions, designing and conducting
experiments, collecting data, drawing conclusions, participat-
ing in scientific discourse, developing novel pedagogical tools,
and communicating findings to advance the field. This experi-
ential learning, as informed by science education research, also
requires creating rubrics to establish goals and outcomes and
to assess learning (46).

The Morrill Act of 1862 establishing land grant universities,
including the University of NebraskaLincoln (UNL), was pro-
found by promoting without excluding other scientific and
classical studies. . .the liberal and practical education of the
industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life
(7). The training in biochemistry at UNL embraces the impor-
tance of broader practical instruction and the training of scien-
tifically literate graduates, which is consistent with the view
that higher education is the major engine for socio-economic
development. The transformation of our programs of study in
biochemistry began in earnest in 2010, beginning with the rec-

Advancement of Science, the National Science Foundation,
and the National Education Council found in seminal docu-
ments, including Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology
Education: A Call to Action (8) and Rising Above the Gathering
Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Eco-
nomic Future (9). This transformation was also informed by
pioneering faculty at the university, in particular that of the bot-
anist Charles Bessey. Bessey was known for innovative teaching
methods that followed his belief that education was to be
informed by research (10). His teaching and research were
experiential and included establishing the classification system
for flowering plants that has become standard. The impact of
his efforts continues to resonate in the Nebraska National For-

est, the first artificial forest that began with his tree-planting
experiments with his students and in the establishment of fed-
eral programs that funded modern agricultural experiment
stations.

The efforts to fully integrate the undergraduate and graduate
education and research missions in the Department of Bio-
chemistry began with the development of guiding principles,
which were founded with the understanding that what we do in
research and teaching is to improve the human condition.
(cid:1) Commit to an uncompromising pursuit of excellence. Com-
mitment to excellence is the firm ethos in teaching and
research and is reflected by excellence in undergraduate
and graduate education, cutting-edge research, and the gen-
eration of knowledge that is world class.

(cid:1) Stimulate research and creative work that fosters discovery,
pushes frontiers, and advances society. The highest stand-
ards for advancing research must be sustained through
extramural funds and publications in the highest-quality
journals in biochemistry and the molecular life sciences.
(cid:1) Establish research and creative work as the foundation for
teaching and learning. Students pursing a biochemistry and
molecular biology degree must be afforded every opportu-
nity to conduct high-impact research in faculty laboratories
with funding from individual grants and institutional pro-
grams that support such research efforts.

(cid:1) Prepare students for life through learner-centered education.
Students must be guided and challenged in classrooms and
laboratories to become independent in seeking the knowl-
edge and skills required to become successful professionals
in biochemistry, molecular biology, biomedicine, and
related fields.

(cid:1) Engage with academic, business, and civic communities
throughout the state and the world. Interactions and collab-
orations in biochemistry extend beyond the walls of the uni-
versity to colleges and universities within the state and
around the world, and through engagement with the private
sector it is essential to bring the products of research and
teaching to consumers as a benefit to society.

(cid:1) Create an academic environment that values diversity of
ideas and people. The faculty and staff of the Department of
Biochemistry at UNL embrace diversity and inclusive excel-
lence as a fundamental core value.

Header: Establishing a scholarly environment where research
informs teaching and teaching informs research

The Department of Biochemistry at

the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln was formally established in its current struc-
ture in 1995. The major immediately became popular, espe-
cially for students wanting to pursue medical school. By 2006,
the department had a number of high-impact and established
research programs, yet as a small research-intensive unit,
teaching was seen as secondary. I joined the department as
Chair in 2008 with a highly productive and externally sup-
ported research program, continuing our efforts to understand
the mechanistic basis of fatty acid transport. Our work had

ASBMB AWARD ARTICLE: 21st century biochemistry and molecular biology education

progressed from a bacterial model and over a 23-year period
had progressed to yeast, mammalian cell culture, and animal
models (e.g. see Refs. 1115). The attraction of leading bio-
chemistry at UNL was that all fundamentals were in place; the
challenge was to move the department into the 21st century by
linking research and teaching in proactive ways through
engagement and new faculty recruitment. At the time, the
department had a robust graduate program with high-caliber
students conducting cutting-edge research.

Three members of the biochemistry faculty were working in
the biochemistry education research space at that time, but
their efforts were not integrated with the traditionally research-
intensive faculty (16, 17). This situation was not unique to
UNL, as there are comparable challenges in the STEM fields
throughout the country, many of which have resulted into two-
tiered departments. To this end, there was a significant uphill
battle that had to occur in moving faculty from the talking
head in course delivery to active learning with full integration
of teaching and learning with research. I had seen this in play
out as an undergraduate student and knew the value of this
linkage and how basic research informed teaching. Further,
during the 22 years prior to assuming the leadership of bio-
chemistry at UNL, my teaching was in both medical and gradu-
ate education, where integrating foundational research into
teaching, including medical biochemistry, was an essential part
of my approach. A number of issues at UNL began to coalesce,
including the opportunity to hire a significant number of fac-
ulty and build a modern, high-impact Department of Biochem-
istry with strong research programs linked to teaching and
learning and meeting the demands of 21st century career paths.
This included hiring 19 new faculty members (2 joint) since
2010 to advance the biochemistry research and teaching mis-
sions. The challenges were to hire both strategically and delib-
erately to strengthen research and teaching and to establish a
faculty with demographics that were shared by the student
population. A central tenant in all of these efforts was one of in-
clusive excellence.

The initial challenge was to convince the traditionalists
that teaching 21st century biochemistry and molecular biology
the way they were taught was inconsistent with training a mod-
ern workforce with a biochemistry education at the core. Part
of this first challenge was eliminated with retirements. The sec-
ond challenge was to identify strategic needs within the unit
that worked collectively to advance both research and teaching.
I likened this challenge to being the conductor of an orchestra,
where all parts are essential and where the whole was greater
than the sum of the parts. If the violins were not in synchrony
with the brass, the result would be catastrophic. If there were
weaknesses in the percussion or woodwinds that needed to be
addressed, this became the priority. As a department chair, I
did not need to tell the faculty what to do but, like a conductor,
had to establish the environment to achieve optimal collabora-
tion and integration among the existing and newly recruited
faculty, professional and technical staff, and students. This
challenge was also mindful of linking research areas and pro-
grams both within biochemistry and with other programs for
added strength and impact. It was also mindful of the changing
face of modern biochemistry and molecular biology to be more

quantitative, especially with the emergence of high-throughout
data and systems biology. A final and important challenge was
to make biochemistry a true academic home for nearly 400
undergraduate majors. This necessitated a careful review of the
curriculum and the establishment of practices where students
were engaged and mentored in their progression through the
program over four years. This also required building a faculty
that valued basic research in biochemistry and molecular biol-
ogy that extended to teaching and learning. The result was a
broad appreciation of the interplay between research that
advanced teaching and learning and the development of novel
pedagogical tools and basic research that generated new
knowledge.

The environment that was established over a 10-year period
was one of inclusive excellence and one that allowed the best
ideas to come forward and be discussed and refined with many
being implemented. During this same period, the research pro-
grams with highly talented graduate students and postdoctoral
research fellows flourished, advancing programs in plant bio-
chemistry, metabolic biochemistry, biomedical biochemistry,
biophysical chemistry, and biochemical informatics. One key
outcome of this excellence was the development of a graduate
training program, supported by the National Institutes of
Health, in the Molecular Mechanisms of Disease. The breadth
of research in combination with changes in the teaching culture
established a landscape required to advance the training of stu-
dents for existing and emerging career paths.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: Leadership, innovation, and team building
Leadership in any academic department requires a long-
term vision, not simply maintaining the status quo and steering
the unit. Like a conductor and their orchestra, academic leader-
ship requires a clear understanding of the team, the measures
of success, and how that fuels the vision. In biochemistry, the
excitement of basic research and the generation of new knowl-
edge is foundational. The hum of active research programs is
contagious and spills into the hallways and seminar rooms
where there is experimental planning, the sharing of data, and
active discussions. As members of a biochemistry department
not associated with a medical school, the graduate and under-
graduate students in the laboratories and classrooms become
part of the fabric and through a fully engaged learning environ-
ment, gain the requisite foundations for their chosen career
paths.

A central component of leadership in biochemistry, espe-
cially in a research-intensive institution, is to lead by example
and embrace the missions of the department. At UNL, this was
the clear expectation of the facultyin essence, leadership that
understood the details of the interrelated academic missions by
being in and coming from the trenches. Academic leadership in
a research-intensive department cannot be equated with just
being a unit administrator. Leading by example was crucial in
building biochemistry and required maintaining a robust
research program with undergraduate and graduate students
(e.g. see Refs. 18 and 19), contributing to the teaching mission
and team building. It also required continual engagement with
the faculty, staff, and students and proactive discussions with

the deans and upper university administration. The balancing
required was much like walking on a floor of marbles and meet-
ing the needs and vision of the faculty using the resources avail-
able through the university.

In 2010-11 and again in 2016-17, the Department of Bio-
chemistry had to complete formal academic program reviews.
As is the case for most academic departments, both were initi-
ated with a self-study, which culminated with guiding princi-
ples and strategic visions. My resolve was that these reviews be
faculty-driven, and indeed this was the case. Both occurred at
the right time in moving the department forward. The first was
significant as it identified the challenges and gaps required to
advance the research and teaching missions into the 21st cen-
tury. The second built on the outcomes of the first and included
a number of new faculty hires that were crucial in developing
the Vision of Excellence 20172022 document that, while
dynamic, has proven highly successful in meeting the chal-
lenges of a 21st century Department of Biochemistry. Following
the first academic program review, key faculty hires were made
that were largely directed to strengthening the research pro-
grams in redox biochemistry, biophysical chemistry, metabolic
biochemistry, plant biochemistry, and systems biology and bio-
chemical informatics. It became important at the time that a
significant effort be made to advance biochemistry in teaching
and learning. During this period and as noted above, the inter-
play between research that advanced teaching and the develop-
ment of novel pedagogical tools and basic research that gener-
ated new knowledge became part of the departmental culture.

The 2016-17 academic program review was able to highlight
the successes of the previous years and set the stage for the con-
tinued growth of the department with the understanding that
research and teaching are interdependent and that strength in
one provides strength to the other. During this period, the
four-year curriculum had been modified to include biochemis-
try courses in each academic year, thus creating an academic
home for the undergraduate students. There were expanded
efforts to engage as many students as possible in basic research
laboratory work in biochemistry and across campus in the
larger molecular life sciences. In concert with these efforts, in-
ternal and external grants were awarded to members of the fac-
ulty to strengthen biochemistry teaching and learningthese
grants were given the same high level of recognition as those
supporting basic research. These efforts were coincident with
strengthening a strong graduate program to include increased
emphasis on the diversity of career paths. All of this was occur-
ring in an environment that was driven by the faculty and from
team building that was coming from within. The outcomes
have been remarkable, with a level of faculty interaction in both
research and teaching and, more specifically, a level of excite-
ment linking the two. In addition to grants being awarded to
support teaching and learning, four members of the faculty
were awarded National Science Foundation CAREER grants in
2018 and 2019. These grants require outreach and education as
central pillars of a cutting-edge research program. I remain
convinced that these awards were successful in large part
because of the environment established in the department that
values research and teaching at the same levelthis is an envi-
ronment of inclusive excellence.

10656 J. Biol. Chem. (2020) 295(31) 1065310661

As the University of Nebraska celebrated the 150th year since
its founding and the Department of Biochemistry its 25th year,
the department was awarded the 2019 University-wide Depart-
mental Teaching Award as one of the Presidents Faculty Excel-
lence Awards. The University of Nebraska system specifically
recognized the tradition of pedagogical excellence through fac-
ulty engagement and innovation. There was praise for the
departments innovative educational programs that emphasize
critical thinking, experimental testing, and molecular and com-
putational modeling that are directly linked to excellence in ba-
sic research in redox biochemistry, biophysical chemistry, met-
abolic biochemistry, plant biochemistry, and systems biology
and biochemical informatics. The department was recognized
for transforming biochemistry education and developing life-
long learners, leading to a number of high-impact career paths.
The linkage between research that advanced teaching and the
development of novel pedagogical tools and basic research that
generated new knowledge was the common thread creating
synergy leading to strength.

Program of study, critical thinking, and importance of
scientific discourse

With the modernization of the biochemistry undergraduate
curriculum to meet 21st century career paths, as is the case in
many programs throughout the country, student engagement
in their learning through critical thinking has become an expec-
tation. It is now the tradition of biochemistry at UNL to present
a body of information in concert with asking where it came
from and how it advanced the field. As noted above, the bio-
chemistry program has been modified to cover all four years.
These changes in the undergraduate biochemistry curriculum
have been driven by the faculty and supported by grants from
the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of
Health, and the Kelly Fund, which is an internal philanthropic
fund that supports advances in teaching and learning. The fun-
damentals are taught, but with a high level of student engage-
ment in current trends in research, thereby providing an im-
portant backdrop to add interest and applicability to the
learning process.

Beginning as freshman, students are introduced to funda-
mental concepts stemming from the ASBMB accreditation
core concepts (energy is required by and transformed in biolog-
ical systems; macromolecular structure determines function
and regulation; information storage and flow are dynamic and
interactive; and discovery requires objective measurement,
quantitative analysis, and clear communication) at the same
time they are taking initial sequences in biology, math, and
chemistry. Student learning is assessed through on-line con-
cept inventories. Students write a position abstract using the
tools of scientific discourse to argue for or against statements
made on a product that claims to be scientifically or clinically
proven. Finally, they write a short scientific paper based on sug-
gested topics within the core concepts that requires mastery of
PubMed, learning to write in their own words, and citations of
at least three primary works using the Journal of Biological
Chemistry format. These efforts are integrated with college
planning and skills, goal setting, discussions of working in a

ASBMB AWARD ARTICLE: 21st century biochemistry and molecular biology education

research laboratory and understanding the importance of
teamwork in learning, and discussions of career paths.

As the biochemistry students progress through the curricu-
lum as sophomores, they are introduced to the critical nature
of biochemical data and in particular how is it generated, inter-
preted, and presented in a scientific publication. These efforts
are completed in concert with more writing and the integration
of the data analyzed with other related works. Students work
individually and in groups of four, with the class size limited to
24. This approach, while demanding, generates much discus-
sion and a clear appreciation of scientific teamwork. Our expe-
rience shows that students taking this course prior to taking the
year-long biochemistry sequence have enhanced performance.
The third year of study includes a two-semester comprehen-
sive biochemistry sequence that has evolved from being pre-
sented in a typical lecture style to one blending experiential
learning and standard lectures. The challenge has been the
delivery of such a biochemistry sequence with 300-350 stu-
dents, including 70-80 biochemistry majors. Faculty that teach
in this sequence have led efforts developing interactive learning
modules using dynamic 3D printed models to allow students to
visualize biomolecular structures. At present, three targeted
learning objectives related to DNA and RNA structure, tran-
scription factor-DNA interactions, and DNA supercoiling dy-
namics have been developed and accompanied by assessment
tools to gauge student learning in a large classroom setting. Stu-
dents had normalized learning gains of 49% with respect to
their ability to understand and relate molecular structures to
biochemical functions (20). The technologies developed are
significant and allow students to understand macromolecular
structure-function relationships and observe molecular dy-
namics and interactions (21). I am quite certain that additional
innovative teaching technologies along these lines will be devel-
oped to enhance learning in this biochemistry sequence. An
additional and highly innovative platform developed by bio-
chemistry faculty, the Cell Collective, uses computational mod-
ules allowing students to gain first-hand experience in areas as
diverse as cellular respiration and the molecular dynamics of
the lac operon (22). These efforts break down the barriers com-
mon in a large classroom setting, allowing students to work in
small groups to understand complex biochemical processes. The
junior/senior laboratory sequence in biochemistry has been mod-
ernized and directly linked to ongoing basic research in faculty
members laboratories. As students gain broad understanding of
basic biochemical concepts, they become well-prepared for
advanced training in biophysical chemistry and structural biology
that includes hands-on experience using programs such as
PyMOL. These later efforts are coordinated with literature
reviews, problem solving, and group presentations.

As seniors, biochemistry students complete a capstone
course in Advanced Topics in Biochemistry with different
topics that range from Plant Metabolic Engineering and Trace
Metals in Redox Homeostasis to Metabolons and Metabolic
Flux and the Biochemistry of Starvation and Obesity. These
classes are limited to 24 students with group discussions that
culminate in writing an advanced scientific paper and presenta-
tions. A central aspect of this course centers on scientific dis-
course with active discussions addressing potential discordance

of data stemming from different experimental approaches. One
instructor uses peer review of the student manuscripts, which
culminates with a compendium of papers in the student jour-
nal, Advances in Biochemistry, that is shared with the class and
archived by the department. Although the topical areas differ
by instructor, this course is assessed using rubrics that are com-
mon among all sections.

For the majority of UNL biochemistry majors, their partici-
pation in laboratory-based research is woven throughout the
program of study. In addition, and importantly, each student is
individually mentored throughout the program of study.

Primary research and creative works and the balance to
maintain excellence in the biochemistry curriculum

The Department of Biochemistry at UNL has top-tier
research programs with research expenditures of $9-10 mil-
lion/year, the majority of which are externally supported by
grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Science
Foundation, USDA, Department of Energy, and private founda-
tions including the American Heart Association and Michael J.
Fox Foundation. Coupled with this strength in research is a uni-
versity-wide and highly impactful undergraduate research pro-
gram, Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experi-
ences (UCARE), that supports students over two semesters or a
summer. UCARE is funded in part by gifts from the Pepsi Quasi
Endowment and Union Bank and Trust. The office of the Agri-
culture Research Division (ARD) also supports academic and
summer research experiences for undergraduate students.
UCARE and ARD students must identify a research mentor
and write a research proposal that is peer-reviewed. In bio-
chemistry, additional undergraduate research students are sup-
ported during the academic year and summer by funds from
individual research grants. These students are guided through
standard operating procedures in research, biosafety, codes of
conduct, expectations for ethical research, finding the right
graduate program, and assistance through the graduate school
application process.

At any given time, there are upwards of 50 undergraduate
research students in the Department of Biochemistry laboratory.
In addition, an additional 8090 biochemistry undergraduate stu-
dents are in the molecular life science laboratory, ranging from
those in the Departments of Chemical and Biomolecular Engi-
neering and Chemistry to those in Psychology and Food Science
and Technology. It is important to point out that many of these
students begin working in a research laboratory in their freshman
and sophomore years and continue through graduation. All of
the undergraduate research students participate in two univer-
sity-wide research fairs, which involve juried poster presenta-
tions. Many of these students present their work in national
forums including the ASBMB Annual Undergraduate Research
Symposium. In addition to these undergraduate research pro-
grams, the university hosts numerous Research Experience for
Undergraduate (REU) programs that are directed to students out-
side the university for research-intensive experiences in the
summer. For those with interests in biochemistry, there are pro-
grams in Redox Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Molecular
Plant-Microbe Interactions, and Virology.

J. Biol. Chem. (2020) 295(31) 1065310661 10657

ASBMB AWARD ARTICLE: 21st century biochemistry and molecular biology education

Embedded within these high-impact research programs are
graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows. At any
given time, there are 3035 Ph.D. students and an additional
3035 postdoctoral research fellows. These laboratories pro-
vide cutting-edge research environments where undergraduate
research students become members of research teams, much in
the same way I did as an undergraduate student.

These research experiences for undergraduate students
occur because all members of the biochemistry faculty (and
others in the molecular life sciences) see this as part of their
scholarly activities and as members of the academy. Whereas
maintaining a high research profile is essential for our institu-
tion, the proactive engagement of undergraduate students is
also part of the fabric of the department.

This brings me back to the orchestra. The conductor gener-
ally does not play an instrument, yet he or she occupies a
unique space between the orchestra and the audience. The con-
ductor must understand the dynamics that occur in that setting
and set the stage to benefit both the audience and the orchestra.
Orchestrating a research-intensive biochemistry department,
like that at UNL, with nearly 400 undergraduate students has
many of the same elements. The cutting-edge research in bio-
physical chemistry or metabolism is part of the foundation. Ini-
tially, the students see such activities as the audience, many as
freshmen as they are introduced to the discipline and asking
the question of why study biochemistry with its demands. They
see the latest papers published from the department faculty on
electronic boards highlighting novel cutting-edge research.
Like a student of the orchestra, they are introduced to a small
part of what we call biochemistry, but with the clear under-
standing that this is only a part of the total. Many students may
not be able to work in in a research laboratory due to a variety
of circumstances. In these situations, they gain experience in a
teaching laboratory that is designed to emulate basic research.
In both situations, these students learn and grow, in both the
laboratory and a classroom that is increasingly experiential.
Through the integration of basic research and modern teaching,
these students become members of the orchestra we call bio-
chemistry. The leadership of modern programs in biochemistry
and molecular biology must facilitate this process. Like the con-
ductor, departmental leadership must understand all aspects of
the orchestra and the audience, in essence research and teaching
and learning. They must establish an environment where stu-
dents are trained in the discipline to advance their chosen career
paths. This is the balance of teaching and research that maintains
excellence in the biochemistry curriculum.

The richness of this type of training environment cannot be
understated. The biochemistry students at UNL have been
highly successful as evidenced by co-authorship on research
papers, presentations, and awards. Over the past five years, bio-
chemistry students have presented their research at
the
ASBMB annual meeting, where they have had opportunities to
talk with the leaders in the field. Several of our students
received outreach grants from the ASBMB, including one to
support the Science Olympiad. Locally, biochemistry under-
graduate research students continue to receive top awards at
the university-wide research fairs. A number of these students
have extended their efforts through participation in activities

10658 J. Biol. Chem. (2020) 295(31) 1065310661

outside the traditional mainstream of basic research. One
example are biochemistry students who have participated in
the International Genetically Engineered Machine (IGEM) pro-
gram. Others have coupled study abroad programs with experi-
ential learning in biochemistry and biomedicine. Prior to grad-
uation, students meet with the department chair, individually
or in small groups, to provide their assessment of the program
over the past five years, the feedback has been uniformly pos-
itive. Finally, and importantly, the majority of biochemistry stu-
dents enter postbaccalaureate programs with a high level of
success, ranging from graduate programs in biochemistry and
molecular biology to medical school, law school, and allied
health programs. Others enter the local biotechnology sector,
and in several cases, these individuals have risen to leadership
roles in a short time.

Header: Biochemistry and the nonmajor, engagement in K-12
education, and outreach

Biochemistry interfaces with many life science and engineer-
ing programs, and through course offerings for nonmajors, the
department continues to occupy an important niche in teach-
ing these students. These efforts are essential to the vitality of
the department and are essential parts of the orchestra. In
many cases, the challenges are greater, as many of these stu-
dents do not have the vested interest in the discipline and are
taking biochemistry courses as part of their degree require-
ments. Nonetheless, members of the biochemistry faculty have
been highly innovative in this space and are now using course-
based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) as part of
these activities, both in large classroom and laboratory settings.
In addition, full on-line versions for summer and continuing
education students and blended learning approaches are also
being fully deployed.

There are now significant efforts coming from the biochem-
istry faculty to engage students in K-12 education. Current
efforts include discipline-based education research and science
literacy programs leading to the development of novel peda-
gogical strategies with a specific focus on developing educa-
tional programs in the molecular life sciences for K-12 schools
and nonformal
learning environments. These efforts are
advancing the departments national leadership in youth educa-
tion in the molecular life sciences, affording increased aware-
ness of and interest in careers related to science. One area of
particular interest is instruction in core biochemistry courses
that serve the broader life sciences community, including deliv-
ery to nontraditional learners (e.g. on-line courses for continu-
ing education).

As part of the culture of inclusive excellence and linking
research to teaching and learning, the department continues to
be active in science outreach efforts. These efforts may be more
minor at the outset, but consider how elements within an
orchestral program come togetherthe tympani or piccolo at
just the right time and with the right amount of emphasis and
impact results in an outcome far greater than the sum of the
parts. These efforts are driven by the faculty that become
involved in university-wide efforts to provide broad exposure
of students, especially those from underserved communities, to

Header: Importance of ASBMB accreditation and maintaining
high standards of excellence for 21st century career
paths

Undergraduate education is a fundamental priority of the
University of Nebraska. The biochemistry faculty have devel-
oped an undergraduate academic program that is directed at
providing the foundation required for careers in industry,
research, education, engineering, health professions, or other
interdisciplinary fields. The B.S. degree is reflective of the disci-
pline as a whole and includes current advances from medicine
to biotechnology. The philosophy underpinning the under-
graduate biochemistry program is a curriculum that includes
coursework in each of the four years of study, individual men-
toring, and the requisite electives for modern career specializa-
tions. Central to this philosophy are pedagogical strategies that
include discussions of current research trends in biochemistry
in the classroom at all undergraduate levels. Finally, and as
detailed above, the biochemistry program works to provide pri-
mary research opportunities for all undergraduate majors, be-
ginning as early as first semester freshman, as part of their
experiential learning.

The Department of Biochemistrys undergraduate program
was accredited by the ASBMB in 2016 for a full seven-year
term. The move to have a fully accredited program was driven
by the high standards expected in the program of study,
ongoing program assessment through concept inventories, and
increased national recognition (2325). The assessment exam
given each year has allowed faculty to identify areas of strength
and weakness in the program of study. One outcome of this
assessment was to develop a senior level course in Biophysical
Chemistry and Structural Biology, which integrates core con-
cepts of physical chemistry with a focus on basic biochemical
mechanisms. Since the biochemistry major was accredited, the
number of undergraduate majors has increased by nearly 20%.
More recently, the department has deployed a second bio-
chemistry track with increased emphasis on biochemical infor-
matics, statistics, and computational modeling. Coincident
with these changes, the department has recently built a Bio-
chemistry Resource Center that provides a visible home for the
biochemistry undergraduate and graduate programs and a fa-
cility with full audio-visual capabilities for individualized study,
tutoring, and small group discussions that include course-based
and research-based efforts.

The finale of a symphonic work comes when all of the parts
are visibleand heardand this collective has lasting impact.
This is not the result of one individual but of the many and, as
noted, requires leadership that allows the best in each part to
come forward. This finale is played in the UNL Department of
Biochemistry just prior graduation in May and December,
where members of the faculty host a Graduation Celebration to
honor individual undergraduate and graduate students and

their accomplishments. This finale extends to the recognition
of biochemistry juniors and seniors as ASBMB Honor Society
(Chi Omega Lambda) members. From 2016 to 2020, 28 of our
students were inducted into Chi Omega Lambda and received
their cords as part of the Graduation Celebration in May in rec-
ognition of their scholarly achievements, research accomplish-
ments, and outreach activities. A final highlight to this finale is
the departments ASBMB-affiliated Student Chapter, which
interfaces with the basic biochemistry research programs
through active discussions with graduate students and postdoc-
toral research fellows, contributes to new student recruitment,
is involved in community outreach and philanthropy, and hosts
programs in career planning. These types of efforts led to the
UNL Biochemistry Club being recognized in 2017 as the
ASBMB Outstanding Student Chapter.

Header: Abstract 
There is a growing interest in changing the culture of psychology to improve the quality of our 

science.  At the root of this interest is concern over the reproducibility of key findings. A variety 

of large-scale replication attempts have revealed that a number of previously published effects 

cannot be reproduced, while other analyses indicate that the published literature is rife with 

underpowered studies and publication bias. These revelations suggest that it is time to change 

how psychological science is carried out and increase transparency of reporting. Unfortunately, 

actual change has been slow, and we argue change will continue to be slow until institutions 

adopt new procedures for evaluating scholarly activity. We consider two courses of action that 

individuals and departments can take that we believe will facilitate change throughout 

psychological science. These two actions are the development of individualized research 

philosophy statements and the creation of an annotated curriculum vitae to improve the 

transparency of scholarly reporting. Our recommendations build on proposals for open science 

by enabling researchers to have a voice in articulating (and contextualizing) how they would like 

their work to be evaluated and by providing a mechanism for more detailed and transparent 

reporting of scholarly activities. 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Central to our motivation for writing this article is the current debate over reproducibility 

within psychological science and other fields, and related discussion regarding incentive 

structures for tenure and promotion. There is broad agreement that the incentive structure for 

tenure and promotion can reward research practices that incentivize novelty, expediency, and 

publication quantity and disincentivize practices that promote rigor, reproducibility, and 

scientific quality (e.g., Edwards & Siddhartha, 2017; Flier, 2017; Nosek, Spies, & Motyl, 2012). 

This is not to say that rigor is not valued by researchers (Ebersole, Axt, & Nosek, 2016), but 

rather that there is no reporting system that allows researchers to document their efforts at 

ensuring quality or facilitate evaluation of participation in robust scientific practices. To be sure, 

problems regarding reproducibility and incentives are multifaceted and cannot be solved with 

any singular reform. However, we believe there are many small nudges capable of better 

aligning the incentive and evaluation structures of our scientific community with the values and 

principles of robust science (e.g., Grand et al., in press; Nosek et al., 2012). We further posit that 

changing culture and practices around these issues will involve empowering researchers to 

reflect upon and publicly express their views on how and why they conduct their research  and 

then allowing them to report the steps they take to meet those expectations.  

To this end, the goal of this article is to describe two interconnected practices that 

individuals and departments can take to encourage researchers to articulate their scientific 

values, incentivize good research practices, and empower researchers to change the way they do 

their work. These practices are (a) the creation of individualized research philosophy statements 

that reflect an individuals core research values and goals, and (b) the use of an annotated 

curriculum vitae (CV) for reporting research productivity and scholarship. We propose that 

giving faculty a voice in how their work should be evaluated and increasing transparency in the 

3 

 
description of scholarship can encourage faculty toward making choices in the conduct of their 

own research that will improve the quality of their scientific output. Further, we argue that the 

research philosophy statement and the annotated CV can facilitate hiring decisions by allowing 

departments to select applicants whose philosophy aligns with their institutional or departmental 

values; that they can improve equity and fairness in the evaluation of faculty for merit pay 

increases; allow tenure and promotion committees to better evaluate the scope of a candidates 

contribution to science and reproducibility; and enable faculty to better reflect on their own 

research progress in light of their philosophy. 

Understanding System Change: Culture, Context, and Criteria 

Research and theory in the psychological sciences has long acknowledged the influence 

that the social systems in which persons and situations reside hold critical implications for 

understanding affect, behavior, and cognition--and how to influence these concepts (e.g., Lewin, 

1947; Simon, 1956; Weick, 1976; 1995). From such work, we recognize that facilitating 

effective change in organizational systems requires knowledge of their culture (i.e., broadly 

shared values, assumptions, and norms that define good vs. bad, acceptable vs. unacceptable, 

desirable vs. undesirable, etc.), context (i.e., local practices, policies, reward systems, etc. that 

codify culture), and criteria (i.e., evaluative standards and related feedback systems reflecting 

how things are/should be done in ways consistent with context; e.g., Cameron & Quinn, 2011; 

Foster-Fishman, Nowell, & Yang, 2007). In the context of nudging our scientific community 

toward more robust and reproducible scientific practices, lessons learned from organizational 

change scientists highlight the criticality of aligning distal cultural values around scientific 

4 

 
 
quality and reproducibility with personal and proximal practices and procedures that support 

those norms. 

Although the decentralized nature of most scientific disciplines and academia tend to 

render these concepts more diffuse and opaque, Figure 1 summarizes our conceptualization of 

these pillars in the context of research science: institutional values, researcher values, and 

transparent reporting of scholarship. Institutions such as ones department, university, and 

discipline play a significant role in conveying the values and expectations for faculty researchers 

(i.e., culture). However, these values and expectations cannot stand alone in guiding researcher 

behavior. Researchers need a way of expressing how their work aligns with institutional values 

(i.e., context) and a mechanism for reporting how their scholarship meets institutional 

expectations (i.e., criteria). Figure 1 also captures what we see as the relationships among these 

pillars. Without doubt, institutions and disciplines exert a strong top-down influence on the 

scientific values and practices which define its community; for example, universities set 

expectations for research productivity and enforce policies for how research productivity is 

reported and evaluated, while disciplines set scientific norms and standards. Though such 

institutions are slow to change and individual faculty (especially those pre-tenure) have few 

opportunities for exacting bottom-up change, feedback loops do exist from faculty and reporting 

mechanisms to these collective levels (the dotted lines). 

To situate this framework within the conversation of robust scientific practices and 

promoting high quality science, consider the typical policies set by institutions for both research 

misconduct and appointment, tenure, and promotion (APT). At the University of Maryland, the 

policy for research misconduct includes language emphasizing scientific integrity: Integrity in 

research is the responsibility of the entire academic community. All members of the university 

5 

 
community  students, staff, faculty and administrators  share responsibility for developing and 

maintaining standards to assure honesty, accuracy and objectivity in scientific and scholarly 

work and other creative activities and detection of abuse of these standards (pg. 4, University of 

Maryland Policy and Procedures Concerning Research Misconduct, 2017).1 The policy defines 

misconduct as fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or any other practice that seriously deviates 

from practices commonly accepted in the discipline or in the academic and research 

communities (pg. 8) and questionable research practices as acts that do not constitute 

misconduct or unacceptable research practices, but that require attention because they could 

erode confidence in the integrity of the research or creative activity (pg. 8). 

In terms of criteria for appointment, tenure, and promotion, the policy at the University of 

Maryland (University of Maryland Policy and Procedures on Appointment, Promotion and 

Tenure of Faculty, 2017)2 provides the following expectations for assistant, associate, and full 

professors (pp. 2-3): 

Appointments at the Assistant Professor level. The appointee shall have 

qualities suggesting a high level of teaching ability in the relevant academic field, 

and shall provide evidence of potential for superior research, scholarship, or 

artistic creativity in the field.  

Appointments at the Associate Professor level. In addition to having the 

qualifications of an Assistant Professor, the appointee shall have a high level of 

competence in teaching and advisement in the relevant academic field, shall have

and shall have shown promise of continued productivity ... 

Appointment at the Full Professor level. In addition to having the qualifications 

of an Associate Professor, the appointee shall have established a national and, 

where appropriate, international reputation for outstanding research, scholarship 

or artistic creativity, and a distinguished record of teaching.

We suspect that these APT and misconduct policies (or their equivalent) are similar to 

how many colleges or university tend to express such values3. Both policies offer few specifics 

regarding what constitutes superior, significant, or outstanding research (in the case of APT) 

or what constitutes questionable and unacceptable practices (in the case of research misconduct). 

Nevertheless, they do broadly characterize the normative standards/statements that reflect key 

institutional values (integrity, superior research, productivity, etc.). 

In many cases, the onus is placed on individual departments to provide more detailed 

definitions of quality. Unfortunately, many departmental criteria for tenure and promotion also 

lack specificity. For example, APT standards for Associate professors in our department call for 

evidence of accomplishment in publishing in prestigious journals; national recognition in an 

area of research; and peer recognition as indexed by citation counts and impact factors (amongst 

other descriptors). However, we note that even at this more constrained level, there is little 

specific guidance on how to define scientific quality. The few criteria often invoked as indices of 

such quality--citation and impact factors--are imperfect at best (for discussion see, e.g., Arruda et 

al., 2016; Hicks, Wouters, Waltman, Rijcke, & Rafols, 2015; Verma, 2015; Declaration on 

Research Assessment, http://www.ascb.org/dora/). Further, what constitutes a questionable 

research practice is of current debate, and there are no agreed upon rules for differentiating 

questionable practices from those that are accepted, but discouraged. For example, some 

problematic practices, such as collecting more data after failing to obtain a significant result or 

selectively excluding (or including) extreme data points are sometimes seen as defensible and are 

3 It bears mentioning that different universities or colleges may hold different values, depending 
on the specific mission of the university of college.

commonly used (Agnoli et al., 2017; John, Loewenstein, & Prelec, 2012; Yu, Sprenger, Thomas, 

& Dougherty, 2014).  

Given that these gray areas can be difficult to define collectively, we believe one viable 

solution is to allow faculty the opportunity to express their own scientific values, contextualize 

their individual approach to science, and report more details about individual pieces of 

scholarship than are currently available. We believe a first step toward achieving this goal is for 

research producers to reflect upon and explicitly describe the context in which their research is 

conducted and how/why this reflects desirable cultural/institutional values. Though there have 

been recent high-profile cases of research misconduct within the psychological and brain 

sciences (e.g., Stapel, Hauser, others) we believe that most scientists embrace or want to embrace 

practices that will ultimately enhance the reproducibility of their science. However, we also 

believe many researchers feel that (a) they have no mechanism for expressing their core 

scientific values and advocating for how those values guide their research practices, and (b) 

institutional incentives and criteria for tenure and promotion serve as barricades as opposed to 

buoys to instituting good practices. We believe that in enacting change to incentivize better 

research practices, researchers should be given the opportunity to more completely communicate 

their specific research values and goals. 

A second critical piece for achieving this goal involves improving and encouraging 

transparency of academic reporting. At research universities, dossiers submitted for APT review 

typically include information on ones program of research (the CV, sample publications, the 

research statement), and detailed information on ones teaching philosophy and effectiveness. 

Though dossiers are intended to enable evaluators to assess the quality and extent of one's 

research productivity, they ironically lack information pertinent to assessing individual pieces of 

9 

 
scholarship (aside from a handful of sample articles). Evaluators are typically forced to over-rely 

on imperfect metrics such as number of publications, journal impact factors, reputation of 

publication outlets, and citation rates. These indices, unfortunately, do not adequately capture 

nuances in ones research efforts and can conceivably even propagate subtle and difficult to 

detect biases. For example, implicit racial or gender biases can adversely affect citation rates 

(Knobloch-Westerwick, Glynn, & Huge, 2013; Maliniak, Powers, & Walter, 2013). On the flip 

side, there is evidence that simply being a graduate from Dr. Big Shots lab (Ball, 2011) and 

posting preprints (Schwarz & Kennicutt, 2004) can increase citation rates. While neither of these 

latter circumstances are inherently bad, they suggest that higher citation rates are not 

necessarily indicative of high quality robust science. In any event, all of these examples highlight 

that citation rates are fallible at best (and misleading at worst) indices of scientific quality and 

impact. 

In what follows, we describe how we believe these currently missing pieces in the 

academic system could be addressed through the adoption of research philosophy statements and 

annotated CVs in academic departments. We discuss the relation of these two elements to 

departmental review criteria and the role of reproducibility in both the development of research 

philosophy statements and annotated CVs. We additionally include suggestions for developing a 

research philosophy statement and choosing dimensions for an annotated CV (examples of each 

are provided online, https://osf.io/gp5qt/).

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: Research Philosophy Statement 
It is common for newly minted PhD students as well as faculty to create Statements of 

Teaching Interests and Research Interests. These statements are intended to articulate in a 

10 

 
 
concise manner ones general approach to teaching and research. One major difference between 

these two documents, however, lies in the strength of their philosophical orientations. Teaching 

statements are frequently organized around ones teaching philosophy. The teaching philosophy 

is a statement about what one values in teaching along with their pedagogy, which reflects and 

guides the actions one takes in the classroom. In contrast, the construction of most research 

statements are, in our experience, much less focused on values and philosophy and more focused 

on describing ones past research, ongoing projects, and future plans. However, we believe that 

research statements can and should also be based on a set of core values in a manner similar to 

how one creates a teaching philosophy. In the same way that articulating ones teaching 

philosophy can motivate proactive changes to align behaviors with values, we argue that a well 

articulated research philosophy can nudge one to take concrete steps toward ethical and 

reproducible research, help communicate how one wishes their work to be evaluated, improve 

training of future scientists, and enable one to reflect on (and easily communicate) their unique 

contribution to their department, university, and discipline.4 

The first step to developing a research philosophy is to identify which specific categories 

to emphasize to describe ones approach to conducting and participating in scientific research. 

There are a variety of categories that could be included, but the key is to document information 

that reflects the ways in which one conducts and contributes to science through their research. 

Box 1 provides examples of five broad categories and related points that could be included in a 

research philosophy, including type of scholarship, data sources, knowledge dissemination goals, 

perspectives on reproducibility and open science, and authorship philosophy. Additionally, these 

categories help further emphasize the many different ways in which research can be conducted. 

4 Although our focus is on the role of a research philosophies within academia, we believe that 
writing and maintaining a research philosophy can be useful in any type of research-oriented 
career.  

11 

 
                                                 
For example, some researchers value tackling broad conceptual problems, whereas others may 

prefer to address specific empirical questions. Some researchers prefer research that has 

immediate translational value, whereas others focus on basic laboratory findings that advance 

foundational knowledge. Finally, some researchers may let their research be driven more by the 

tools they have at their disposal and address a wide range of questions afforded by those tools, 

whereas others may be more motivated by theoretical questions and use tools as a way to address 

those questions.  

Although researchers likely contribute in many ways using a variety of approaches, there 

are also likely stable individual differences. Importantly, differences across faculty in their 

approach to science can lead to very different looking CVs, even if the body of work itself is 

essentially identical. For example, some faculty may expect to be included as authors on 

publications based on student dissertations and theses, whereas others may view dissertations 

and theses as providing an opportunity for students to publish independently. Some faculty 

participate in large collaborative networks and gain authorship on many papers for which their 

individual contributions may be important, but more diffuse; others may choose to work with 

only a few collaborators but play a larger role in each publication. Some labs may institute 

policies that require internal replications and open science practices, whereas other labs may not 

follow such practices. All of these choices involve trade offs -- trade-offs that are reflective of 

ones general approach to science. Diversity in both approach and practice can and should be 

valued to promote robust science (Grand et al., in press), but we lack methods for explicating and 

making the value of these differences understood by evaluators and members of our scientific 

community. We believe that allowing researchers to succinctly summarize their approach to 

12 

 
conducting science provides a critical and needed outlet for researchers to provide information 

on how their research is conducted rather than only what is produced. 

Of final note, it is important to not only describe what ones core values are in the 

research philosophy, but also why those are important for ones work. Recall that a primary 

purpose of the research philosophy statement is to provide context to ones scientific work in a 

manner that links practices to institutional values. Reflecting on and providing information about 

both how and why an individual conducts research in a particular manner serves two goals. First, 

it provides the researcher an opportunity to articulate a vision for their research process (i.e., 

how one carries out scientific research rather than the outcomes of that research per se) and 

identify the strategies they use (or strive to use) to achieve that vision. Notably, this is consistent 

with current best practices in performance management systems promoted in the organizational 

sciences which emphasize the importance of employee voice, commitment, and engagement in 

establishing collectively agreed upon performance criteria (Aguinis, 2013; Aguinis, Joo, & 

Gottfredson, 2011; Den Hartog, Boselie, & Paauwe, 2004). Second, it provides institutional 

evaluators and members of the scientific community critical information about the ways in which 

researchers carry out their research activities that is not -- and cannot be -- adequately reflected 

by current metrics of research productivity. This point implicitly recognizes the critical 

difference between evaluating scientific quality in terms of performance-as-results (i.e., number 

of publications, impact factor of publications) versus performance-as-behaviors (i.e., what 

researchers do to generate research outputs; e.g., Beck, Beatty, & Sackett, 2014; Campbell, 1990; 

Viswesvaran & Ones, 2000). Changing researcher behavior will only happen if behavior is what 

is valued. Continuing to emphasize what we do/produce while wishing to change how we 

do/produce is nothing more than the folly of rewarding A while hoping for B (Kerr, 1975).

In sum, articulating a clear research philosophy allows researchers to state their values 

and research goals as well as indicate how their research activities align with the values of a 

department, university, and discipline. It also better enables researchers to reflect upon what they 

do well, and identify specific elements of their research approach that may need greater attention. 

A research philosophy that addresses some or all of the above categories also increases the 

transparency of ones research goals and enables evaluators to better contextualize the scope of 

ones scholarly activity. This latter point implies a need to link the research philosophy to 

appropriate indicators in a transparent way so that individuals (and evaluators) can evaluate their 

progress in light of the stated philosophy and goals. Below, we illustrate how this can be done 

through the use of annotated CV.   

Annotated Curriculum Vitae 

Though the research philosophy may be useful by itself, it is also important to consider 

methods for evaluating how well ones research output conforms to their stated values. That is, 

we believe there needs to be a parallel mechanism for measuring or documenting how well one 

achieves the values espoused in a research philosophy. We suggest that the CV is one 

appropriate and underutilized place for this. The CV serves as a summary document of ones job 

experience and includes items such as education, awards, grant activity, service activities, and 

evidence of scholarship. Each of these items can, and sometimes are, annotated. For example, the 

entry for education may include recognition for honors, the researchers specialty area, and the 

title of ones thesis or dissertation. Grants often include information regarding the funding 

agency, priority score, funding amounts, title, and a brief description. Surprisingly, however, 

researchers rarely annotate individual pieces of scholarship, even though doing so could be 

16 

 
 
 
enormously helpful for articulating the scope and unique contribution of their published work. 

We propose that annotating individual publications can serve the broader goal of connecting 

one's scholarship to both his or her research philosophy and to institutional or departmental 

values.  

Evaluations of faculty typically do (and should!) consider more than research 

contributions, but research productivity measured in terms of number of publications is clearly a 

major factor for research-oriented universities. The standard CV in most dossiers includes a list 

of published papers, usually broken up into peer reviewed research articles and non-peer 

reviewed papers. Papers are typically listed on the CV in citation format, with little to no 

information pertaining to the type of paper, the scope of the research/scholarly activity, or effort 

undertaken for ensuring reproducibility. We propose a simple modification to this format to 

explicate the unique contribution of each paper along a set of agreed upon dimensions. We 

suggest that the number of dimensions remain relatively small so as to keep the process from 

becoming overly burdensome. While there are many relevant dimensions that a department may 

wish to capture on an annotated CV, we recommend the seven dimensions listed in Box 2 as 

starting points. Of course, exactly what should be included on an annotated CV should be 

decided upon by individual departments/institutions and should reflect that institutions specific 

values. For reference, for the annotated format in Box 2, we found that it takes no more than 1-2 

minutes per article to document these details for each article, and note that some of these 

proposed dimensions are already material required by some journals.

The benefit of the annotated CV is that it highlights the types of trade-offs in research and 

publication that are routinely made and which presumably are guided by one's research 

philosophy/values. For instance, an annotated CV that indicates the number of experiments in a 

paper and the number of subjects per experiment enables evaluators to better take into 

consideration the scope of ones work, and make better comparisons to disciplinary norms. In 

some contexts, five single-experiment papers might be functionally equivalent to one or two 

multi-experiment papers in terms of the scope of the work; in other contexts a single-experiment 

paper may be equivalent to a multi-experiment paper (e.g., longitudinal data, client/case study 

work). The annotated CV also enables one to better document how their research output fits 

within their own research philosophy and their contributions to science and/or outreach. That is, 

it allows researchers to provide more complete criteria for evaluating and understanding the 

nature of their work. Authors who value fewer more inclusive pieces of work over multiple more 

concise contributions will not feel disincentivized to pursue this approach if they know that the 

effort will be recognized. Moreover, those who make an explicit effort to ensure reproducibility 

will not feel penalized for the extra effort required to conduct replications or gather larger 

samples, and may even feel incentivized if those efforts are made transparent to evaluators. In 

short, the annotated CV serves a critical role by closing the feedback loop between 

departmental/institutional and researcher values. It not only enables one to capture what research 

is being produced, but to again showcase how and why that work aligns with and contributes to 

the goals and values of ones scientific community. 

Note that the article details in Box 2 do not focus solely on reproducibility, nor are all 

aspects of reproducibility easily captured by these dimensions. Even the reporting of sample size 

can be difficult to interpret without knowledge of the experimental design. However, the details 

19 

 
add information over current practice that should allow evaluators to better understand the type 

of product, scope of work, and overall contribution. It also provides faculty with a way of 

documenting extra steps that they might have undertaken but that are not evident in the final 

products, such as an unpublished replication, additional analyses that were conducted on the data 

to verify the results, cross-validation, or quantitative modeling efforts. Recognizing that there are 

many ways to do good science and improving transparency of reporting should empower faculty 

to take steps to improve their own science.

Header: DISCUSSION 
In a recent paper in Nature, Jeffrey Flier (2017) argued that reproducibility and 

robustness are under-appreciated in decisions regarding appointment, tenure, and promotion of 

faculty. Flier (2017) also suggested that greater emphasis be placed on critical self-reflection, 

an increase in institutional incentives to increase transparency and data sharing, and better 

metrics for evaluating research publications. Though we agree with Fliers general sentiment, the 

burning question is how real change can take place. There is no one-size-fits all approach to 

science, so instituting change is not as easy as setting institutional mandates and expecting 

faculty to fall in line. We advocate for an approach that asks institutions to set broad guidelines, 

but allow individual faculty the flexibility to set an agenda that explicates their own values and a 

provide a mechanism for transparently reporting the details of specific pieces of scholarship.  

Though the research philosophy and annotated CV are documents created by individual 

faculty, both documents should be informed by institutional values. Indeed, we suggest that 

departments develop reporting dimensions included in the article details section of the annotated 

20 

 
 
 
 
CV that have a clear connection to criteria that can be useful for evaluating tenure and promotion 

(see Box 3 for some suggestions). This is not to say that each dimension will relate directly to 

some institutional criterion, but rather that the collection of criteria will permit a more holistic 

evaluation of individual pieces of scholarship. The holistic evaluation should, in principle, enable 

one to better judge the contribution of individual publications and nudge evaluators away from 

relying too heavily on number of publications, impact factors, or journal reputations, and instead 

rely more on factors like effort, workload, rigor, reproducibility, and scope of scientific 

contribution (cf. Hicks et al., 2015). Departments may still desire to use number and impact 

factors as part of the evaluation process; however, we believe that these dimensions are best 

viewed alongside information about how researchers conduct their scientific efforts. Because 

there are many ways in which good science can be conducted, having a more complete and 

balanced way of describing and evaluating ones research activities should incentivize good 

scientific behavior.

Box 3. Recommendations for creating a research philosophy & annotated CV 

Research Philosophy: What should your research philosophy look like? We suggest a relatively 
short statement that:  

(1) Clearly articulates a set of core values. These may or may not include your position along 
the dimensions described above (e.g., Box 1), but definitely should indicate the aspects of 
your own approach to research that you consider most important. Your philosophy need 
not address every nuance: Focus on those elements that form your core values. 
(2) Clearly articulates the focus of inquiry and scope of your research program. This is 

perhaps the most similar to content in the more typical research statement, but certainly 
the topics and focus of ones research is an important part of the research philosophy. 
Detailed descriptions of the program of research and future directions are important, but 
perhaps best saved for the broader statement of research. 

(3) Includes concrete examples. A research philosophy is less valuable if it simply reiterates 
a set of buzzwords, instead it should include specific illustrations of your research 
philosophy and priorities. Details and examples can help, and note that these need not be 
examples from your own research. For example, if you value open science practices but 
have not yet made the transition yourself, you can still articulate this as one of your core 
values and point to specific examples of your aspirational practices (e.g., McKiernan, 
2017).  

(4) Reflects how ones work strives to achieve institutional or departmental values. 
(5) Links to the dimensions reflected on the annotated CV.  

Annotated CV: We suggest departments work to develop a format for an annotated CV that: 

(1) Includes reporting criteria that are informed by your institutions values and disciplinary 

norms.  

(2) Includes elements that are easy to report, as objective as possible, and verifiable.  
(3) Provides an opportunity for faculty to contextualize (i.e., increase transparency, provide 
information for evaluators) their research contributions. This is important in part because 
research in the psychological and brain sciences is incredibly diverse in terms of content, 
norms for sample sizes, applicability of research to applied problems, theoretical 
orientation, methodology, and even where the lead author is placed in the authorship list. 
This diversity makes it difficult for non-experts in a field to interpret the scope of 
individual pieces of scholarship.  

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The replication crisis within psychology and other fields has brought to light the need to 

both incentivize and encourage the conduct of reproducible research. We argue that the creation 

of research philosophy statements and the use of annotated CVs can play an important role in 

nudging scientists toward better research practices both by encouraging scientists to articulate 

their scientific values more fully and by allowing transparent reporting of their efforts. While 

many scientists support the open-science movement, there has been little discussion regarding 

how to document the efforts of scientists who choose to use open-science practices. Likewise, 

while many scientists value the concept of replication, replication efforts are often not 

documented. Encouraging scientists to report reproducibility efforts within the annotated CV will 

both (a) incentivize researchers to do more to ensure that their work is reproducible, even when 

these efforts are not ultimately included within publications, and (b) enable colleagues to better 

evaluate the scope of ones research and the degree to which his or her work adheres to 

departmental, university, or disciplinary standards.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: Broadening the definition of reproducibility  
We have been careful throughout this article to discuss the concept of reproducibility in 

the broadest sense possible. There is a tendency for individuals to equate the term 

reproducibility with replication (e.g., Benjamin, et al., 2017; Crane, 2017, November 19). 

This is unfortunate because the terms can and should be viewed very differently (see 

https://www.statnews.com/2016/06/01/reproducibility-science/). Replication implies that a 

particular experimental finding would be observed if an experiment were repeated, and therefore 

focuses on the outcome of a particular experimental study. Of course, experimental findings 

might not replicate for any number of reasons, not the least of which is that nature, and in 

23 

 
 
 
particular behavior, is variable and often context dependent. A failure to replicate does not imply 

that a researcher has necessarily engaged in nefarious behavior, as even well intentioned and 

careful science can fail to replicate. We believe that refocusing efforts towards the process by 

which research is performed--that is, how and why research is conducted-- can help our field 

move beyond  disagreements over (falsely) dichotomized outcomes (e.g., what constitutes a 

successful replication, what constitutes a significant finding, etc.). We therefore argue for a 

broader definition of reproducibility that focuses on process as opposed to outcome. Here, we 

identify four dimensions of reproducibility that we believe are particularly suitable for 

explicating in a research philosophy statement, and which can be captured by the annotated CV. 

Reproducibility of experimental methods.  This dimension refers to the ability to carry out 

(i.e., reproduce) an experimental design as closely as possible to the original experiment. Can 

one reproduce an experiment from how it is described in a method section? Some journals permit 

sufficient space to provide detailed descriptions of an experiments, but others do not. Open 

science practices (placing material and methods online) can ensure that the methods of any 

experiment can be accurately reproduced. 

Reproducibility of findings. This refers to ones ability to reproduce the statistical results 

from the original data. Given the original data, can the same statistical results be recreated? This 

requires making the data available either upon request or in an open science format, providing 

details on the use of data editing procedures, and elucidating the choices that were made in 

deciding which statistics to run (e.g., which version of a t-test was chosen).  

Reproducibility of statistical conclusions. This refers to the question of whether statistical 

conclusions can be reproduced under different assumptions about the data. Reproducibility of 

statistical conclusions is different from reproducibility of statistical findings in the sense that a 

24 

 
specific value of a statistical test may be reproduced (a statistical finding), but that the value of 

that test and the statistical conclusion may be sensitive to the assumptions of the particular 

statistical test chosen by the researcher. Consider a case where the results of a Mann-Whitney U 

and a two-group t-test yield different statistical conclusions; the case in which a statistically 

significant effect at the conventional alpha level of p=0.05 yields inconclusive evidence against 

the null hypothesis (Wetzles, Matzke, Lee, Rouder, Iverson, & Wagenmakers, 2011) or the case 

where different (justifiable) prior distributions yield different conclusions. In all three cases, one 

may question whether the statistical conclusions are reproducible. Reproducibility of statistical 

conclusions entails asking whether the same conclusions would be drawn with alternative 

analysis methods or different data editing decisions (Dougherty, Thomas, Brown, Chrabaszcz, & 

Tidwell, 2015). In the context of Bayesian methods, this may entail conducting analyses using 

different specifications of the prior (i.e., sensitivity analysis). An extreme version of 

reproducibility of statistical conclusions is suggested by Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelsons 

(2015) Specification Curve analysis, which essentially tests statistical conclusions validity by 

analyzing the data across hundreds if not thousands of potential specifications of the data (e.g., 

different outlier deletion methods, different transformations), inclusion of different covariates, 

and different statistical modeling approaches. 

Reproducibility of an experimental result. This dimension refers to the question of 

whether a particular experimental result can be replicated. Replicability is important for 

validating empirical findings. Although there is debate about what exactly counts as a successful 

replication, few would argue with the conceptual argument that valid empirical findings should 

in principle be replicable. Of the four dimensions presented here, replication is by far the most 

stringent test of reproducibility. However, we believe that any replication attempt should be 

25 

 
interpreted within the context of the variability that is inherent in the behavioral sciences. In this 

sense, a study may be reproducible, even if the experimental result is not replicable.

At its heart chemistry is about putting substances together and pulling them apart, 

synthesizing and analyzing, and about explaining how that takes place.  Under some 

circumstances this coming together and breaking apart is natural in that it occurs without 

direct planning or intervention on the part of the chemist.  In these situation it is the role 

of the chemist to explain and understand what happened and why. Under other 

circumstances the phenomenon is planned for in the sense of being designed to meet 

certain purposes.  In these situations it is the role of the chemist to predict, design, and 

modify what happens and why.  What makes chemistry hard to learn and to understand is 

that both the level at which actions occur and the mechanisms by which they occur is 

atomic or subatomic.  It is not simply that such activity can not be seen but that these 

molecular activities do not appear at the noticeable human scale. The pathway from 

atomic level structure to macroscopic features is complex and indirect. In addition, it is 

not possible to directly manipulate the microscopic features, making it difficult to 

develop intuition for the connection between the microscopic and macroscopic scales 

(Harrison & Treagust, 2004). 

Chemistry is distinct from the other sciences (geology, biology, physics) in that it 

concerns itself with atoms and molecules thus concerning itself with issues intermediate 

between physics and biology.  It is a domain that is partly reductive and partly 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos

SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

descriptive.  On the other hand it is a discipline of hyphens: bio-chemistry, geo-

chemistry, physical chemistry precisely because it overlaps both in technique and 

fundamental inquiry the ranges of these other sciences.  It is an enormously significant 

discipline for issues that range from environmental problems and their solutions to 

understanding medical mysteries such as HIV and finding weapons to attack them.  It is a 

pragmatic discipline that has given us modern dye technology, silly putty, and plastics.  It 

is home to the display of physical beauty inherent in crystal structures and it is this 

exciting and elegant world that the student is invited into by studying and learning 

chemistry. 

Chemistry has proven to be a challenging subject in the school curriculum 

(Erduran, S. & Scerri 2004; Gilbert et al, 2004).  No doubt this is for many of the same 

reasons that other sciences are challenging: it relies on mathematics, it has a unique and 

specialized vocabulary, it requires extreme attention to small distinctions, it operates at a 

non-human scale, it problematizes the world in a non obvious and non trivial manner.  

But there are intuitive resources for learning chemistry as well, chemistry and its 

fundamental ideas are manifested all around the young student.  Water commonly exists 

in three states of matter: liquid, solid, and gaseous. Its crystal form of snowflakes hints at 

its underlying chemical structure. It is the role of education to support the question of 

how? Bicycle chains rust, aluminum screens oxidize, and the student has witnessed 

chemical combustion (cid:150) it remains for the teacher to support the answers to the questions 

of why? The cook slowly stirs a sauce with eggs or corn starch and as if by magic the 

mixture suddenly thickens and takes on a new consistency.  What is happening and why 

was heat needed?

Even with the existence of a set of examples from which to build and intuitions 

which can be nurtured there are some serious and rather unique challenges to the teaching 

of chemistry.  Some of these challenges have been studied in carefully controlled 

research studies Harrison & Treagust, 2004), others are inferred from what we know 

about learning in other scientific fields ( Hunt & Minstrell, 1994; Lehrer et al, 2000). We 

focus on three here and will return to them throughout the rest of the paper.  First, the 

scale of processes both in terms of size and time is both below the human eye and not 

quite within the realm of easy imagination; twirling electrons linking things together is 

unlike most common experiences of joining and separating, the action is at the individual 

molecular level but the recognition is at the macroscopic level leaving the connection 

slippery indeed some have suggested teaching only within the molecular level to deal 

with this issue (Tabor & Coll, 2004).  Second, keeping track of which of many levels is 

the targeted one for a particular action or state -- locating a pointer into the complex 

system in terms of time and action is tricky.  Finally, the specific mathematical ideas of 

chemistry: the multiplicative structures of ratios and intensive quantities that are so 

elusive even to adults in medicine and engineering and that require careful 

understandings of the units that begin and the units that complete an action, dimensional 

analysis, is complex. 

Our goal in this paper is to argue for several deep concepts in chemistry that can 

provide accurate and honest leverage to ideas throughout chemistry but which are 

accessible in some sense from the beginning.  This means simplifying for younger 

students can not be done in a way that must be undone at a later time. The proposed 

concepts are shape and structure, transformation, and energy and motion.  We are 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 3 

 
 
 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

not arguing that these concepts are exhaustive but rather that they do an enormous 

amount of work in thinking about and in the domain. We are also arguing that these ideas 

be thought of as conceptual resources to be built up rather than learning objectives to be 

met. We arrived at this position by considering both what the activities of chemists 

actually are and what chemists do when thinking through a problem carefully before 

thinking about formulas or even principles.1 

The rest of the paper examines what chemists do and how we might think about 

the overall organizations of chemistry drawing heavily on some recent work that 

contrasted chemistry texts with scientific discoveries as reported in the popular press and 

with Nobel prizes awarded in the last half century (Evans et al, 2004). We present some 

of the most common activities of chemistry and give a brief overview of conceptual 

resources.  We then go into considerable detail about each of the resources: what they 

are, how the actions of chemists use these resources, what natural resources for learning 

are and where the challenges exist, we provide a few examples , and then link the ideas in 

the resources to national standards and some texts. We conclude the paper with a 

chemistry scenario and some thoughts concerning for critical features for immersion 

activities that might develop these resources.  Throughout we provide examples of what 

we are discussing and ground each examination in the substances of water, plastic, and 

gold to provide a familiar anchor for considering these ideas. 

What Chemists Do 

1 We consider the idea of periodicity to be also of fundamental importance as an explanatory and 
organizational feature of chemistry.  We did not choose it for two reasons, first it is already well 
represented in most chemistry instruction; second, it has moved from its venerable position in the 
Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century as an explanatory tool to an object of explanation from the atomic 
structure and the Schroedinger equations.

SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

In our previous contrast between work in chemistry and discussions in texts and 

standards we asserted that there was a serious disconnect between the sequence and 

emphasis of ideas in most texts, curricula, and even standards and what the essential 

aspects of chemistry actually appear to be (Evans et al, 2004).  In this paper we expand 

that idea to include an analysis of essential ideas within the field of chemistry and a set of 

anchored examples that span grade levels. 

Chemists analyze matter to determine its composition, they synthesize and design 

new combinations for particular purposes, and they explain the actions and reactions of 

molecules at the atomic and macroscopic levels.  To do these activities they make use of 

a variety of tools.  Instruction in chemistry has focused considerable attention on the tools 

and on appropriate use of tools.  But current investigations into learning and 

remembering has emphasized that knowledge of devices or procedures, such as tool use, 

tends to be easily forgotten and be unavailable for use in a circumstance other than the 

one in which it was learned (Greeno, 1997) If it is taught as a separated set of skills to be 

later assembled or put to use.  Further, our own investigation into what exactly was 

reported on in terms of chemistry results or findings and what was rewarded in terms of 

Nobel prizes showed an emphasis on synthesizing or design activities, analytic activities, 

and explanatory activities.  If these are the action systems of chemistry then our proposed 

resources must support and aid this type of chemistry understanding.  Tools need to be 

taught within the context of their use, not as a set of disconnected skills that will be 

needed at some distant time.

Figure 1:  Activities adapted from Evans, Karabinos, Leinhardt and Yaron (2004) 

Figure 1 displays the main activities of chemists.  It is derived from the figure 

reported in Evans et al (2004). The activity of designing and synthesizing refers to the 

construction of new materials with desired properties. The design process is comprised of 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

the desired function of the material, the structure used to achieve this function, and the 

process used to create this structure. Each of these design activities falls into general 

patterns that we refer to as motifs.  Functional motifs include such things as catalysts, 

materials, new elements, energy, and drugs (cid:150) they are the motivations or goals for the 

design activity.  Structural motifs include polymers, simple molecules, and 3-D networks 

(cid:150) they are structures that the chemist believes may exhibit the desired function. Process 

motifs include chemical design, biological engineering, separation, or formulation (cid:150) they 

are processes or transformations that lead to the desired chemical structures. Taken 

together the constellation of actions associated with designing and synthesizing are how 

chemists make things. 

The activity of explaining refers to the manner in which observations are 

interpreted and accounted for by chemists either when they are responding to something 

new and unknown or when they are intentionally developing something to behave in a 

particular way. In explaining chemists generate plausible hypotheses at the level of 

observation of phenomenon (macro-properties, reactions) in coordination with what is 

known at the level of chemical operation (micro) and then set about testing those with the 

set of tools that are appropriate.  Some of the chemical level knowledge that supports the 

generation of hypotheses includes: types of reactions, periodicity, properties of atoms and 

molecules, kinetics, equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics, and structures.  In 

constructing explanations chemists make extensive use of several representational 

systems to demonstrate the logic and sensibility of their results. 

The activity of analyzing refers to the process by which chemists determine the 

make up of materials. Analytical goals include determining both the structure of the

                          Page 7 

 
 
 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

chemical components (qualitative analysis) and their amounts (quantitative analysis). The 

processes used in analysis include various means for separating mixtures into their 

chemical components and means for determining the structure of molecules. The 

processes of isolation or separation for the purposes of analyzing a chemical mixture link 

closely with the separation processes used for the synthetic goal of extracting a useful 

molecule from an available mixture. 

These are the activities that comprise the work of chemists.  They allow chemists 

to seek answers to a specific set of questions: What is it, what does it do, and what is it 

good for? This is the set of questions that provoke chemical analysis. How can I build it 

or improve it? Is the question that provokes the activity of design and synthesis.  How do 

I know and why is it so? Provokes the activity of explanation. To engage in these 

activities chemists make use of a powerful set of conceptual resources. Figure 2 displays 

the conceptual resources that we consider to be especially significant.  By conceptual 

resources we mean a type of intellectual touchstone that serves the core activities of

conceptual resources on which we are focusing are shape and structure, assembly and 

transformation, and energy and motion.

Shape. Structure and shape is a core idea in chemistry because it provides one of 

the main explanatory and manipulative frameworks for the field. By structure we mean 

the arrangement of atoms in a material. These arrangements in turn effect the known 

properties of a substance allowing for both prediction and explanation. Chemists have a 

developed a variety of notational systems at the atomic and molecular level, orbitals, 

configurations, Lewis Dot, VSEPR,  that support the description and manipulation of 

structural information. These notational systems have the advantage of allowing one to 

directly operate on the representation itself and quickly and intuitively explore and 

communicate structural ideas. The properties of a system are viewed as emergent from 

the structure, so that structure is the defining characteristic of a chemical system. 

Structural information spans a hierarchy from atomic structure to molecular structure to 

the structure of three dimensional assemblies. Atomic structure refers to the configuration 

of electrons within an atom, which establishes the number of bonds it would like to form 

with adjacent atoms (its valency). Molecular structure refers to the arrangement of atoms 

within a molecule. These molecules form three dimensional structures that can be either 

well defined (crystals) or more amorphous (glasses) and dynamic (liquids, gasses). 

Organic chemistry introduces an intermediate level of hierarchy, the functional group 

(alcohol, aldehyde, carboxylic acid), that consists of a few atoms arranged in a specific 

manner. Functional groups convey specific properties and behaviors onto the parent 

molecule. Envisioning a large molecule as being composed of functional groups (as 

opposed to atoms) therefore provides a useful means for understanding its properties and 

behaviors.

The notion of chemical structure goes well beyond shape to encompass a variety 

of features that results from the arrangement of nuclei and electrons. For instance, refined 

notations of shape include the spatial location of groups such as hydrogen bond donors 

and acceptors that influence the way molecules interact with one another and so help 

establish the structure of assemblies. In rational drug design, chemists optimize a drug by 

examining molecules whose structures are (cid:147)similar(cid:148) to those of a molecule with known 

drug activity.  

Measures used to define (cid:147)similar(cid:148) give insight into how the domain envisions 

chemical structure. Such measures include the overall size and shape of the molecule, the 

absolute and relative spatial position of various functional groups, and the location of 

electron rich and deficient regions. Beyond shape, are aspects of a system that are 

(cid:147)obvious(cid:148) to a chemist based on its structure, but do not directly relate to shape. For 

instance, the presence of an (cid:150)SH group means the molecule will have a pungent odor. Or 

the structure of ozone implies that it is highly reactive. 

Structure plays a central role in the construction of explanations, with molecular 

structure typically taking center stage. Certain properties, such as reactivity or color, can 

often be understood directly in terms of molecular structure. Other properties, such as 

hardness, boiling point, and malleability are properties of the assembly. However, 

arguments still typically begin with the molecular structure and bridge to the assembly 

through the way in which structure influences the interactions between molecules.  A 

sensible goal for instruction, one that meshes with all current standards, is to have student 

be able to explain observations and the basis for their predictions(cid:151)in chemistry, 

understanding at some level the idea of structure permits such explanations to join the

larger (cid:145)family(cid:146) of chemical explanations.  But as a considerable quantity of research has 

shown positioning students so that they can and do learn and use these processes of 

accountability to the field in their explanations is by no means trivial. (Lehrer et al 2000, 

Schwart & Martin, 2004). One difficulty in constructing an explanation from structure is 

that what appears at the collective level (reduced volume when colder, for example) does 

not take place at the molecular level (cid:150) molecule do not shrink they pack closer (Bodner & 

Herron, 2004). 

Molecular structure also plays a central role in design, since synthetic chemistry 

gives direct control of the placement of atoms in a molecule.  The central location of 

activity is at the molecular level leaving the total 3-Dimensional assembly as more of an 

emergent property. When the target of the design is a particular assembly, the 

manipulation still occurs at the molecular level. The intent is that features conveyed on 

the molecules will cause them to assemble into the desired structure.  

The target of a chemical analysis is the type (qualitative analysis) and amount 

(quantitative analysis) of all chemical substances in a given sample. Type is essentially 

defined in terms of molecular structure, since two molecules are considered identical if 

they have the same structure. The viewpoint of molecules as being constructed from 

functional groups is a key aspect of qualitative analysis, since many analytical techniques 

(spectroscopy) suggest the presence of a particular functional group and/or give 

information on its proximity to other functional groups. Senses such as taste and smell 

are often also sensitive to the presence of functional groups and this is why, for example, 

both sugar and saccharine both taste sweat.

A challenging aspect of building up an understanding of structure is that one 

must move flexibly between the various levels/scales of structure. Atomic structure 

determines the preferred number and arrangement of bonds around an atom, thereby 

establishing molecular structures. Molecular structure, in turn, determines the interactions 

between molecules and so establishes the structure of molecular assemblies. Explanations 

regarding properties of the assembly must move between the molecular structure itself, 

the manner in which this structure can influence interactions with other molecules and 

then the nature of the resultant assembly. A similar process occurs in design, since one 

may need to make a molecular structure that infers a particular property onto the 

assembly. Macroscopic properties are therefore (cid:147)emergent properties(cid:148) of molecular 

structure that are very nontrivial to predict.  

The difficulty of trying to predict the macro behavior from the micro 

organizations is present at the forefront of the domain. For example, in the design of 

polymers that will lead to plastics with desirable properties chemists must place their bets 

based on deep understanding of the shape and structure of what is already known. 

Learning the domain in part means acquiring intuitions such as: (cid:147)small spherical 

molecules will tend to be gaseous(cid:148), (cid:147)long stringy molecules will tend to form plastics(cid:148), 

and (cid:147)small polar molecules will tend to form tight crystals(cid:148). Naturally, students will not 

have all of these ideas of structure immediately available from the beginning.  The point 

here is that building from rather simple notions of structure students can begin to make 

use of the concept as a resource in explaining, analyzing, and synthesizing.  Structure in 

and of itself is a highly intuitive notion that supports the concept of agency in chemistry.  

As Schauble and Lehrer have pointed out the idea of agency is particularly crucial to 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 12 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

scientific and mathematical understandings in young students (Lehrer and Schauble, 

2004). 

Crossing between the various levels of the hierarchy is made especially 

challenging by the need to invoke different argumentation or explanatory frameworks at 

each level. The levels do not combine like a set of Russian dolls. At the atomic level, one 

argues in terms of the arrangement of electrons in atomic orbitals. At the molecular level, 

one argues in terms of both the arrangement of nuclei in the molecule and the behavior of 

the electrons moving among these nuclei. Molecular structure is sufficiently rich that 

chemists have evolved a number of notational systems. In some cases, such as Lewis-dot 

vs. bond diagrams vs. Fisher diagrams, the different notational systems focus attention on 

different aspects of what is essentially a single model of the molecule. In others, such as 

Lewis-dot vs. molecular orbital diagrams, the notational systems represent different 

models of the system that are complimentary but occasionally hard to reconcile. 

Water provides an exemplar for how molecular structure, in this case a bent 

molecule that can both donate and accept two hydrogen bonds, leads to the emergent 

properties of ice, liquid water, and water vapor/clouds. On a more refined level, structural 

arguments can account for water having the unique property of being less dense as a 

crystal than a liquid, thus water when it is cold enough to form a solid takes up more 

space than when it is warm enough to be a liquid, an (cid:147)exception to the rule(cid:148) that makes 

ice float and therefore plays an important role in everyday life. The inertness and 

malleability of gold provides another example of how structure can account for 

properties.  In this case the relatively simple structure of stacked spheres leads to an 

easily deformable material.

Structure and shape also provides an inroad to understanding the principle 

activities of practicing chemists. In both the pharmaceutical and polymer industries, 

chemists take advantage of the structural diversity of organic molecules by designing 

molecules to perform certain tasks. An important aspect of rational drug design is the 

tuning of structure--add a group here, remove a group there(cid:151)to obtain a drug that binds 

tightly to the target protein. This lock and key vision should be elaborated to a 

deformable lock and key, but the centrality of structure remains. Highly deformable 

proteins such as HIV(cid:146)s integrase make the search for the correct drug structure (the key) 

harder, but the process remains one of hunting for the structure that will stick most 

strongly to integrase.  

The polymer industry discovers and optimizes materials by working at multiple 

structure levels. Varying the repeat unit of the polymer leads to gross differences in 

properties, from the foam cup of polystyrene to the slick surface of Teflon to the clear 

properties of polyX (plexiglass). But keeping the repeat unit the same and changing the 

structure of the assembly by promoting more close-packed structures or building 

chemical bonds between polymer chains (cross-linking) is also a powerful design 

approach. For instance, the plastic used to build lawn chairs and that used for (some 

application of high density polyethylene) are both based on polyethylene. But the process 

is not always one of intentional design. Both conducting polymers and Kevlar were 

discovered while their inventors were in search of materials with other properties. 

Developing the ideas of structure as conceptual resources will assist in meeting a 

variety of national and state standards.2  Standards in the early grades emphasize knowing 

2 We include an appendix that shows in greater detail the ways in which the developing of these resources 
would support advancement in learning state and national standards objectives.

many of the ideas but not necessarily understanding the way that they act within the 

activities of chemistry. For example, middle school standards frequently require students 

to describe substances in terms of properties that are structural in nature.  Students are 

also required to explain changes in terms of underlying characteristics of materials 

(Middle School: Wisconsin D.4-8.1-2; California 8th grade section 3; Pennsylvania 

3.4.7A; Colorado 2.1; Atlas 4D. High School: Colorado 2.1; Pennsylvania 3.4.10.A, 

3.4.12.A; Wisconsin D.12.-2.5.8; California  9-12 Chemistry Sections 1-2; Atlas 4D).  

Thus, we are arguing that a target for instruction be a set of activities that bring 

increasingly sophisticated ideas of chemical structure to the fore.  Notational resources 

should only be built up in the service of one or more of the identified activities.  Structure 

in and of itself is reasonably clear but the understanding of the relationship between the 

micro (cid:150)atomic or molecular structure and the observed phenomenon and the fact that it is 

not recursive makes the idea difficult. 

Transformation. Structure accounts for the arrangement of electrons, atoms, and 

molecules. Transformation focuses on the processes that can lead to structural change. 

Conservation of matter dictates that such transformations involve only rearrangements of 

the atoms and not the magical addition of new matter. The type of transformation that 

takes place relates to the level of the structural hierarchy at which the transformation 

takes place. Rearrangements of molecular structure, through the breaking and formation 

of chemical bonds, correspond to chemical changes. Chemical changes are typically 

associated with gross changes in a system(cid:146)s properties and are difficult to reverse.  

Rearrangements of molecules to change an assembly, for instance by melting ice 

or dissolving sugar in water, correspond to physical changes. In a physical process the 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 15 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

chemical bonds of the molecule remain intact and it is only the interactions between 

molecules that are altered. We point this out because so many texts and even standards 

introduce the idea of physical versus chemical changes at very early levels and tend to 

treat them as if they were both quite simple to understand and not subtle with respect to 

chemistry itself; we do not agree. 

Both chemical and physical transformations make use of classes of 

transformation as a basis for explanation. Chemical transformations occur through 

chemical reactions. Reasoning about reactions is done in terms of general classes such a 

redox, acid-base, or displacement reaction. Associated with each of these reaction types 

is a substantial framework that supports predictions of a reactions spontaneity, energetics 

and speed. For instance, half-cell potentials support predictions of the spontaneity of 

redox reactions, and acid dissociation constants do likewise for acid-base reactions. 

Physical transformations also fall into general classes such as changes of state (melting 

ice), dissolution (dissolving sugar in water), or precipitation (making rock candy from a 

sugar solution). Each class again has a predictive framework. For instance, phase 

diagrams provide a notational formalism for organizing data on changes of state and 

using the data to make predictions. 

Explanations based on transformations are typically constructed by first 

attempting to fit the observed phenomenon into one of the known general classes, which 

then brings the explanatory framework of that class to bear on the system. The process by 

which one classifies a new phenomenon is essentially reasoning by analogy with known 

and well studied reactions or physical transformations. Obtaining the correct match can 

be quite subtle and will typically lead only to a hypothesis which then must be tested 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 16 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

through various analytical means. Even the classification of a process as chemical or 

physical can be difficult from simple observations. Hammering a piece of gold into gold 

leaf is clearly a physical transformation since the material retains is chemical character. 

However, consider the heating of water and Mercuric Oxide.  In both cases, a gas is 

formed that, on cooling, reforms the initial material. That the first is a physical 

transformation and the second is chemical transformation requires experiments that 

reveal the character of the gas being formed. The classification is then typically based on 

rules of thumb: when heating of a substance leads to reversible formation of a gas, it is 

most likely a physical (evaporation) transformation. Such rules allow one to select the 

most likely hypothesis. 

Structure is the means for specifying the target of a chemical design. 

Transformation is the means of achieving that target. Indeed, molecular synthesis can be 

viewed as the use of chemical reactions to create a molecule of interest. In the twentieth 

century, chemists developed a wide range of reactions that allow construction of 

essentially any molecule of interest. Much less advanced is our ability to arrange 

molecules in specific patterns. The predominant means is to construct molecules that will 

spontaneously form the desired structure. This spontaneous formation of structure, driven 

by the shape of the molecule, is called (cid:147)self assembly(cid:148). Directed assembly is in its 

infancy, with elegant demonstrations such as the use of metal tip to push argons atoms on 

a surface to, for instance, give the smallest known writing of the letters IBM.

are important tools for analysis of chemical samples. Analysis 

of complex samples typically begins with a separation of a mixture into its molecular 

components, a physical transformation. In qualitative analysis, the substances with which

a molecular will react provide keys as to its identity. An example is the classic 

experiments where students identify unknown ions by measuring which solutions, when 

added, will induce precipitation reactions. In quantitative analysis, transformations lie at 

the heart of titrations. In a titration, the amount of a substance is determined by slow 

additions of known amounts of a reactive species. At the endpoint of the titration, the 

reactive species has completely transformed the substance to a different structure. The 

amount of reactive species that must be added to reach the endpoint is a measure of the 

amount of substance present before the titration. 

Transformations are a routine part of everyday life, as such they form the basic 

foundation for an array of intuitions with which the student and teacher can work. The 

physical processes of molding gold or plastic into a new shape, dissolving sugar in water, 

and boiling water contrast with the chemical processes of combustion, the rusting of a 

nail, the yellowing (oxidation) of plastic, and the solidification of an egg when cooked. 

Seeing and beginning the explanation of these phenomenon support the extension of 

intuitions into solid explanations. 

The national and state standards emphasize the significance of ideas of 

combination that lead to changes at the molecular level.  In middle school the emphasis is 

on knowing that these things occur while in High School the emphasis is on 

understanding and explaining through analysis and synthesis; we noted that several 

standards seemed to skip ideas of transformation and move directly to consequences or 

attributes of such transformations. (Middle School: California Grade 8 section 5;

 Energy and Motion. Energy and motion are core concepts in chemistry (Gilbert, 

et al, 2004). The flow of energy in a system plays an important role in determining how 

and why certain processes occur. Controlled flow of energy is also often a goal of 

chemists, as in the design of fuels or batteries. Energy and motion are also a central 

component of our visualizations of the microscopic world; the structure of a material is 

not static, but rather molecules and atoms are continually moving. The timescales on 

which this motion occurs forms the basis for spectroscopy, perhaps the most powerful 

tool for analyzing chemical samples.  

Energy appears as both the kinetic energy of heat and the potential energy of 

chemical bonds. Heat is the energy associated with random, undirected motion of atoms 

and molecules. Temperature is a measure of the energy stored in this random motion. The 

formation of bonds releases energy in the form of heat while breaking bonds requires 

energy such as heat or light. During chemical transformations, energy flows between the 

potential energy of bonds and the random kinetic energy of heat this means that chemical 

reactions can consume or release heat. 

The random motion associated with heat occurs at all levels of the structural 

hierarchy, and different formalisms and representations are used to visualize or account 

for these. For motion at the molecular level, it is useful to envision chemical bonds as 

springs, which are continuously vibrating. Chemical transformations involve the breaking 

of some springs and creation of new ones. These processes of breaking and making bonds

                          Page 19 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

are typically accelerated by increasing the temperature and thus the degree of random 

motion in the system.  

Motion at the assembly level can be used to understand the states (gas, liquid, 

solid) of matter. In gases, molecules are moving freely as individual particles, undergoing 

occasional collisions with one another and with the walls of the container. This 

microscopic picture accounts for gasses tendency to expand to fill the available space and 

for their low density. In liquids, the molecules are in close contact with one another but 

can nevertheless slip by one another with relative ease. In solids, the molecules are 

trapped at specific points in the material; they can vibrate about this position but can not 

move over long distances. Both liquids and solids are dense, since the molecules are 

packed closely together, but only liquids flow, since the molecules in a solid are not free 

to slip by one another. The physical transformation between states is associated with the 

random motion of heat. When a solid is heated to its melting point, the random motion 

associated with the heat is sufficient to break apart the solid lattice and let molecules 

move about more freely. When a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the random motion 

is sufficient for molecules to break free of one another and move about in an isolated 

manner. 

Chemists have developed a number of refinements on the energy concept., most 

notably, free energy and activation energy. These refinements bridge energy to 

transformations. A transformation is possible if it goes downhill in free energy. Note, 

however, that the introduction of free energy is a nontrivial extension of the energy 

concept(cid:151)energy is a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics whereas free 

energy is a consequence of the second law. Activation energy is also a nontrivial 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 20 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

extension of the energy concept. It can be visualized as barrier or mountain over which a 

system must climb to achieve a transformation. The activation energy connects energetics 

to the speed of a transformation with low activation energies being associated with fast 

transformation. 

Light-matter interactions provide a direct probe of the motions occurring in a 

material. The oscillating electric field of the light interacts with motions that occur at the 

same frequency/speed as the light. Microwaves interact with rotational motions of 

molecules, infrared radiation interacts with bond vibrations and visible/ultraviolet light 

interacts with the motion of electrons. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) operates at the 

extreme low-energy side of the electromagnetic spectrum, using radio waves to reorient a 

nuclei(cid:146)s magnetic moment in an applied magnetic field. At the high-energy extreme, X-

rays and gamma rays are emitted by nuclear transformations or are absorbed by 

molecules leading to the breaking of chemical bonds.  

The notion of energy in chemistry is that of thermodynamics, which is 

considerably different than the mechanical energy of Newtonian physics. The most 

accessible exemplar of chemical energy is heat, but heat has a number of known 

conceptual difficulties. It is not a physical entity, as in Lavoisier(cid:146)s phlogiston, but yet can 

flow between substances. Heat is an object whereas cold is not(cid:151)cold does not transfer to 

an object but heat does.  Cold is the loss of heat or energy. For the student and the early 

scientists alike this is not an obvious idea (Goedhart & Kaper, 2004).  

The interplay between the potential energy of chemical bonds and the random 

kinetic energy of heat is also known to be conceptually hard. The language of (cid:147)storing 

energy in chemical bonds(cid:148) brings up a false notion that breaking a bond somehow 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 21 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

releases energy. (A misconception present even in beginning graduate students in 

chemistry.) The nature of chemical energy storage is considerably more subtle. It also 

takes energy to pull two bonded atoms apart and thereby break a bond. In combustion of 

wood, for instance, it takes energy to break the carbon-carbon (C-C) and carbon-

hydrogen (C-H) bonds. However, the formation of the combustion products of carbon 

dioxide and water involves forming very strong carbon-oxygen (C-O) and oxygen-

hydrogen (O-H) bonds. The energy released on the formation of the C-O and O-H bonds 

is much larger than the energy needed to break the C-C and C-H bonds, so there is a net 

release of energy. Chemical energy storage then operates by forming weak bonds that can 

later be exchanged for strong bonds. 

The motion of chemical systems brings in another challenging issue of scale. 

Microscopic motions occur on time scales that are beyond the realm of everyday 

experience. For instance, it takes about 10-14 seconds for a bond to vibrate, corresponding 

to 1014 vibrations each second. Rotations are about 100 times slower, which is still 

outside the realm of everyday experience. However, an intuitive notion can be developed 

for relative time scales(cid:151)in the time it takes a molecule to go through one full rotation, its 

bonds vibrate 100 times. Similarly, in the time it takes for a bond to vibrate once, the 

electrons will have orbited tens of times.  

The framework developed for describing flow of energy in a system are powerful 

resources in the construction of explanations. For instance, this resource allows the 

release of heat during combustion to be linked to structural notions of bond strengths. 

Free energy enables predictions of whether a process can occur. Activation energy 

connects energetics the speed at which a transformation occurs. Motion is also important 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 22 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

in explanations. For instance, motion is essential for understanding the proclivity of a gas 

to fill the available volume or the fluid nature of the liquid state. 

In chemical analysis energy is often a target of the analysis but is rarely a useful 

tool for performing an analysis. For instance, analysis may reveal the energy given off by 

a reaction and so help characterize the potential of a material to act as a fuel or energy 

storage material. However, measurements of the energy are rarely used to identify an 

unknown substance.  Motion, on the other hand, is one of the most powerful tools of 

modern chemical analysis since it can be directly detected by light through spectroscopy. 

For instance, functional groups have specific frequencies at which their bonds vibrate and 

these can be detected with infrared spectroscopy. These frequencies then serve as 

fingerprints for identifying the presence of that functional group in a molecule, 

supporting molecular structure determination (qualitative analysis). The amount of light 

absorbed gives information on the amount of the molecule that is present (quantitative 

analysis). 

In chemical design energy may be an important target as in the creation of energy 

storage materials for batteries. Energy also plays into the design process. For instance, 

bond strength considerations can help determine whether a certain structure is likely to be 

stable. Free energy considerations can help determine whether a transformation needed to 

create the desired material is indeed possible. Design may also pay attention to the 

motions occurring in the material to achieve certain desired properties. For instance, in 

liquid crystal displays (LCDs) some molecular motions are designed to be liquid-like 

while others are designed to be solid-like.

Heat is one of the best instantiations of chemical energy since it is so much a part 

of our everyday experience. Chemical combustion is our primary source of heat and 

energy generation. We are also concerned with removing heat from a system whether it is 

the state change of a liquid to a gas as in the way in which air conditioners usually work 

or by melting ice to cool a glass of water. Chemical bonds mediate energy flow in the 

biosphere, with animals consuming the hydrocarbons and gain energy through controlled 

combustion (calories!) releasing CO2 in water that plants later combine with sunlight and 

water. These examples provide a base from which to nourish a student(cid:146)s understanding of 

the interplay of energy and heat in chemical systems. 

The national and state standards emphasize the significance of energy and the 

specific ideas around heat, flow and reaction. The standards seem to emphasize a series 

of specific pieces of knowledge without the functionality and sense of role that we have 

tried to provide.  In middle school the emphasis is measuring quantities associated with 

energy and energy transfer. In High School the emphasis is on linking phases of matter 

with the appropriate kinetic and molecular theories.  The work on the development of the 

resource associated with energy and motion described here connects to the following 

standards most directly. (Middle School: California Grade 8 3d,e, 5c; Colorado 5-8 2.2, 

2.3;  Wisconsin, D.8.4,6,8,9; Pennsylvania, 3.4.7B; Atlas 4D/3-4.  High School:

A Concluding Example 

We think that our analysis of three of the conceptual resources and the scientific 

activities of chemists allows us to consider the nature of activities that might be of use in

the classroom.  We start with some assumptions.  First, students have intuitions that can 

be stretched, molded, and built upon that are useful in developing these resources 

(Schwartz & Martin, 2004).  Second, one task of instruction is to share with the student 

the ways in which the chemists problematize the world around them and a good approach 

to doing that is to make use of observed, or observable familiar phenomenon (Lehrer & 

Schauble, 2004). Third, by starting with something simple and yet provocative we can 

(cid:145)hang onto(cid:146) a few examples that are revisited over the grades we can both make the ideas 

more subtle and complex and develop and increasingly sophisticated notion of agency.  

In the example that follows we emphasize building up the conceptual resource of 

structure and shape in order to engage in the activities of explaining, synthesizing, and 

analyzing. 

Real and Wet. Water and oil provide a setting from which to explore chemical 

structure and physical transformations. For example, comparing the states of the pure 

substances gives a sense of their underlying structure. Frozen water is a hard crystalline 

solid while frozen oil is a more plastic solid. This can be understood in terms of water 

being a small molecule that solidifies with a well-defined structure while oil consists of 

flexible chain molecules that solidify by collapsing into a spaghetti-like mass. The 

molecular structure is reflected also when water and oil are liquid, with the chain 

structure of oil leading to a more viscous liquid than water. Finally, oil vaporizes at a 

higher temperature than water because the larger size of the molecules requires more heat 

energy to launch them into the gas phase than is needed for the smaller water molecule.  

Addition of a salt lowers the freezing point of water and raises its boiling point.  

These colligative properties can also be understood at a molecular level. The salt

                          Page 25 

 
 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

interferes with the formation of the ice lattice, lowering the temperature at which the 

lattice begins to form. The interaction between salt and water is stronger than that 

between water itself, so salt makes it harder for water to break free from the liquid into 

the gas phase. This accounts for salt raising the boiling point. 

The solubility of other molecules in water versus oil provides an opportunity for 

students to use notions of structure to make predictions and explain. That oil and water 

do not mix gives insight into the fundamental rule of solubility: like likes like. Oil and 

water are very different structurally and so do not mix. Substances will be soluble in 

liquids that are structurally similar. Sugar, with its many O-H bonds, is structurally 

similar to water and so dissolves preferentially in water. If sugar is shaken in a mixture of 

water and oil, it will choose to reside in the water layer. Capsin, the substance that makes 

red pepper, is structurally more similar to oil than water and so, when shaken in a bottle 

containing both oil and water, it will choose to reside in the oil layer. Ideally, we can 

identify a number of substances that dissolve in oil or in water to various degrees, so that 

the partitioning between the oil and water layers is easily visualized. 

The difference in solubility between oil and water provides a powerful means for 

separating molecules. In the chemical technique named extraction, a substance is shaken 

in a container with water and oil, or any other two immiscible solvents. In this manner, 

the oil soluble substances can be (cid:147)extracted(cid:148) from the mixture by pouring off the oil layer 

and leaving the water soluble substances behind. This technique would allow students to 

use structural principles as resource for analyzing samples, for instance, by separating 

the salt from the oil in a puree of potato chips. Such separation are also a common

process in chemical synthesis, allowing one to, for instance, extract or caffeine from tea 

or coffee. 

The resources developed through activities relating to solubility can be brought to 

bear on explaining the mechanism of soap or the nature of biological membranes. Both 

rely on phospholipids, molecules that have a water-loving head attached to an oil-loving 

tail. Soap washes away substances that aren(cid:146)t usually soluble in water because the 

phospholipids arrange themselves in a sphere with their heads pointing into the water and 

their tails pointing inside the sphere to form an oil environment in which the dirt is 

soluble. These spheres are referred to as micelles. Reverse micelles make water soluble 

substances soluble in oil by pointing their tails out into the oil and their heads into the 

solute. A biological membrane is formed by making a double layer, with the heads 

pointing both outside the cell and inside the cell, such that the inside of the membrane 

consists of tails arranged end to end.  

Virtual and Dry. There is enormous power, we believe, in using an apparently 

simple set of circumstances as the basis for a real investigation that can be developed 

over a long time and with increasing levels of sophistication as is the case with water and 

oil.  However, the issue of the conceptual difficulty posed by moving from the 

microscopic reality which is unseeable and mysterious to the macroscopic visible one 

remains.  The location of action in chemistry is molecular and the location of observation 

is molar. 

Computer simulations may help overcome some of the conceptual challenges in 

connecting the microscopic to the macroscopic. As discussed earlier, this connection is 

difficult not only because of the large changes in scale, but because of the indirect means

through which structure manifests at the macroscopic level and the lack of a direct means 

to manipulate and visualize the microscopic. A number of tools exist for visualizing 

molecular structure. Such tools can make the three dimensional structure of molecules 

quite vivid and are perhaps the best way to convey the immense complexity of a 

biological molecule such as hemoglobin. However, such visualizations leave the student 

in the microscopic scale and do not help bridge to the macroscopic. 

Simulations can also provide animated images of molecular motion. For instance, 

simulators are available that show the molecules of a gas moving quickly through space 

and colliding with each other and the walls of the container. Students can control 

variables such as the temperature, allowing an exploration of the effects of temperature 

on molecular motion. These simulations also allow the connection between motion and 

macroscopic properties to be developed. For instance, the pressure of the gas can be 

connected to the collisions of the molecules with the walls of the container. The rate of 

reactions can also be partially understood in terms of the frequency with which two 

molecules collide and so have the opportunity to react. One can envision extending these 

simulations to include physical transformations such as the melting of ice or boiling of 

water. 

The ideal simulation would be one that provided a learning environment in which 

students develop and use the resources of structure, transformation, and energy to 

pursue explain, analysis and design activities. The development of such an environment 

is by no means obvious. To build notions of structure, a desirable feature is the ability to 

directly manipulate molecular structure and see its macroscopic consequences. The 

challenge is that the connection between structure and properties is an unachieved target 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 28

of modern chemistry and so can not yet be simulated in a general manner. Plastics may 

provide an opportunity for a limited simulation in which the structural diversity resulting 

from choice of monomer, molecular chain length, and degree of cross linking is 

sufficiently narrow to be amenable to a simulation while still giving students a wide 

latitude in terms of structural choice. If the simulation produced quantities such as 

density, melting point, brittleness that are of importance to construction of chairs, combs 

or other objects, then students could engage in a design process where direct 

manipulation of chemical structure is used to pursue a macroscopic goal. 

In this paper we tried to identify the key conceptual resources of chemistry and 

the ways in which they are used by chemists. We consider the resources to be broad ways 

of envisioning the microscopic world and how that world interplays with the 

macroscopic. As such, they provide overarching themes that can be introduced early to 

students and developed as students move through the curriculum.  The educational task 

that remains is not to make students into little chemists but to help them share some of 

the chemists world view.  This means that we need to find effective means of supporting 

students as they learn to problematize the world around them in ways that are familiar to 

chemists, as they develop a sense of agency or mechanism that resonates with that of the 

chemists, and as they begin to explain things in a way that is consistent with that of the 

chemist.

many of the ideas but not necessarily understanding the way that they act within the 

activities of chemistry. For example, middle school standards frequently require students 

to describe substances in terms of properties that are structural in nature.  Students are 

also required to explain changes in terms of underlying characteristics of materials 

(Middle School: Wisconsin D.4-8.1-2; California 8th grade section 3; Pennsylvania 

3.4.7A; Colorado 2.1; Atlas 4D. High School: Colorado 2.1; Pennsylvania 3.4.10.A, 

3.4.12.A; Wisconsin D.12.-2.5.8; California  9-12 Chemistry Sections 1-2; Atlas 4D).  

Thus, we are arguing that a target for instruction be a set of activities that bring 

increasingly sophisticated ideas of chemical structure to the fore.  Notational resources 

should only be built up in the service of one or more of the identified activities.  Structure 

in and of itself is reasonably clear but the understanding of the relationship between the 

micro (cid:150)atomic or molecular structure and the observed phenomenon and the fact that it is 

not recursive makes the idea difficult. 

Transformation. Structure accounts for the arrangement of electrons, atoms, and 

molecules. Transformation focuses on the processes that can lead to structural change. 

Conservation of matter dictates that such transformations involve only rearrangements of 

the atoms and not the magical addition of new matter. The type of transformation that 

takes place relates to the level of the structural hierarchy at which the transformation 

takes place. Rearrangements of molecular structure, through the breaking and formation 

of chemical bonds, correspond to chemical changes. Chemical changes are typically 

associated with gross changes in a system(cid:146)s properties and are difficult to reverse.  

Rearrangements of molecules to change an assembly, for instance by melting ice 

or dissolving sugar in water, correspond to physical changes. In a physical process the 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 15 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

chemical bonds of the molecule remain intact and it is only the interactions between 

molecules that are altered. We point this out because so many texts and even standards 

introduce the idea of physical versus chemical changes at very early levels and tend to 

treat them as if they were both quite simple to understand and not subtle with respect to 

chemistry itself; we do not agree. 

Both chemical and physical transformations make use of classes of 

transformation as a basis for explanation. Chemical transformations occur through 

chemical reactions. Reasoning about reactions is done in terms of general classes such a 

redox, acid-base, or displacement reaction. Associated with each of these reaction types 

is a substantial framework that supports predictions of a reactions spontaneity, energetics 

and speed. For instance, half-cell potentials support predictions of the spontaneity of 

redox reactions, and acid dissociation constants do likewise for acid-base reactions. 

Physical transformations also fall into general classes such as changes of state (melting 

ice), dissolution (dissolving sugar in water), or precipitation (making rock candy from a 

sugar solution). Each class again has a predictive framework. For instance, phase 

diagrams provide a notational formalism for organizing data on changes of state and 

using the data to make predictions. 

Explanations based on transformations are typically constructed by first 

attempting to fit the observed phenomenon into one of the known general classes, which 

then brings the explanatory framework of that class to bear on the system. The process by 

which one classifies a new phenomenon is essentially reasoning by analogy with known 

and well studied reactions or physical transformations. Obtaining the correct match can 

be quite subtle and will typically lead only to a hypothesis which then must be tested 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 16 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

through various analytical means. Even the classification of a process as chemical or 

physical can be difficult from simple observations. Hammering a piece of gold into gold 

leaf is clearly a physical transformation since the material retains is chemical character. 

However, consider the heating of water and Mercuric Oxide.  In both cases, a gas is 

formed that, on cooling, reforms the initial material. That the first is a physical 

transformation and the second is chemical transformation requires experiments that 

reveal the character of the gas being formed. The classification is then typically based on 

rules of thumb: when heating of a substance leads to reversible formation of a gas, it is 

most likely a physical (evaporation) transformation. Such rules allow one to select the 

most likely hypothesis. 

Structure is the means for specifying the target of a chemical design. 

Transformation is the means of achieving that target. Indeed, molecular synthesis can be 

viewed as the use of chemical reactions to create a molecule of interest. In the twentieth 

century, chemists developed a wide range of reactions that allow construction of 

essentially any molecule of interest. Much less advanced is our ability to arrange 

molecules in specific patterns. The predominant means is to construct molecules that will 

spontaneously form the desired structure. This spontaneous formation of structure, driven 

by the shape of the molecule, is called (cid:147)self assembly(cid:148). Directed assembly is in its 

infancy, with elegant demonstrations such as the use of metal tip to push argons atoms on 

a surface to, for instance, give the smallest known writing of the letters IBM. 

Transformations are important tools for analysis of chemical samples. Analysis 

of complex samples typically begins with a separation of a mixture into its molecular 

components, a physical transformation. In qualitative analysis, the substances with which 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 17 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

a molecular will react provide keys as to its identity. An example is the classic 

experiments where students identify unknown ions by measuring which solutions, when 

added, will induce precipitation reactions. In quantitative analysis, transformations lie at 

the heart of titrations. In a titration, the amount of a substance is determined by slow 

additions of known amounts of a reactive species. At the endpoint of the titration, the 

reactive species has completely transformed the substance to a different structure. The 

amount of reactive species that must be added to reach the endpoint is a measure of the 

amount of substance present before the titration. 

Transformations are a routine part of everyday life, as such they form the basic 

foundation for an array of intuitions with which the student and teacher can work. The 

physical processes of molding gold or plastic into a new shape, dissolving sugar in water, 

and boiling water contrast with the chemical processes of combustion, the rusting of a 

nail, the yellowing (oxidation) of plastic, and the solidification of an egg when cooked. 

Seeing and beginning the explanation of these phenomenon support the extension of 

intuitions into solid explanations. 

The national and state standards emphasize the significance of ideas of 

combination that lead to changes at the molecular level.  In middle school the emphasis is 

on knowing that these things occur while in High School the emphasis is on 

understanding and explaining through analysis and synthesis; we noted that several 

standards seemed to skip ideas of transformation and move directly to consequences or 

attributes of such transformations. (Middle School: California Grade 8 section 5;

 Energy and Motion. Energy and motion are core concepts in chemistry (Gilbert, 

et al, 2004). The flow of energy in a system plays an important role in determining how 

and why certain processes occur. Controlled flow of energy is also often a goal of 

chemists, as in the design of fuels or batteries. Energy and motion are also a central 

component of our visualizations of the microscopic world; the structure of a material is 

not static, but rather molecules and atoms are continually moving. The timescales on 

which this motion occurs forms the basis for spectroscopy, perhaps the most powerful 

tool for analyzing chemical samples.  

Energy appears as both the kinetic energy of heat and the potential energy of 

chemical bonds. Heat is the energy associated with random, undirected motion of atoms 

and molecules. Temperature is a measure of the energy stored in this random motion. The 

formation of bonds releases energy in the form of heat while breaking bonds requires 

energy such as heat or light. During chemical transformations, energy flows between the 

potential energy of bonds and the random kinetic energy of heat this means that chemical 

reactions can consume or release heat. 

The random motion associated with heat occurs at all levels of the structural 

hierarchy, and different formalisms and representations are used to visualize or account 

for these. For motion at the molecular level, it is useful to envision chemical bonds as 

springs, which are continuously vibrating. Chemical transformations involve the breaking 

of some springs and creation of new ones. These processes of breaking and making bonds

are typically accelerated by increasing the temperature and thus the degree of random 

motion in the system.  

Motion at the assembly level can be used to understand the states (gas, liquid, 

solid) of matter. In gases, molecules are moving freely as individual particles, undergoing 

occasional collisions with one another and with the walls of the container. This 

microscopic picture accounts for gasses tendency to expand to fill the available space and 

for their low density. In liquids, the molecules are in close contact with one another but 

can nevertheless slip by one another with relative ease. In solids, the molecules are 

trapped at specific points in the material; they can vibrate about this position but can not 

move over long distances. Both liquids and solids are dense, since the molecules are 

packed closely together, but only liquids flow, since the molecules in a solid are not free 

to slip by one another. The physical transformation between states is associated with the 

random motion of heat. When a solid is heated to its melting point, the random motion 

associated with the heat is sufficient to break apart the solid lattice and let molecules 

move about more freely. When a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the random motion 

is sufficient for molecules to break free of one another and move about in an isolated 

manner. 

Chemists have developed a number of refinements on the energy concept., most 

notably, free energy and activation energy. These refinements bridge energy to 

transformations. A transformation is possible if it goes downhill in free energy. Note, 

however, that the introduction of free energy is a nontrivial extension of the energy 

concept(cid:151)energy is a consequence of the first law of thermodynamics whereas free 

energy is a consequence of the second law. Activation energy is also a nontrivial

                          Page 20 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

extension of the energy concept. It can be visualized as barrier or mountain over which a 

system must climb to achieve a transformation. The activation energy connects energetics 

to the speed of a transformation with low activation energies being associated with fast 

transformation. 

Light-matter interactions provide a direct probe of the motions occurring in a 

material. The oscillating electric field of the light interacts with motions that occur at the 

same frequency/speed as the light. Microwaves interact with rotational motions of 

molecules, infrared radiation interacts with bond vibrations and visible/ultraviolet light 

interacts with the motion of electrons. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) operates at the 

extreme low-energy side of the electromagnetic spectrum, using radio waves to reorient a 

nuclei(cid:146)s magnetic moment in an applied magnetic field. At the high-energy extreme, X-

rays and gamma rays are emitted by nuclear transformations or are absorbed by 

molecules leading to the breaking of chemical bonds.  

The notion of energy in chemistry is that of thermodynamics, which is 

considerably different than the mechanical energy of Newtonian physics. The most 

accessible exemplar of chemical energy is heat, but heat has a number of known 

conceptual difficulties. It is not a physical entity, as in Lavoisier(cid:146)s phlogiston, but yet can 

flow between substances. Heat is an object whereas cold is not(cid:151)cold does not transfer to 

an object but heat does.  Cold is the loss of heat or energy. For the student and the early 

scientists alike this is not an obvious idea (Goedhart & Kaper, 2004).  

The interplay between the potential energy of chemical bonds and the random 

kinetic energy of heat is also known to be conceptually hard. The language of (cid:147)storing 

energy in chemical bonds(cid:148) brings up a false notion that breaking a bond somehow 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 21 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

releases energy. (A misconception present even in beginning graduate students in 

chemistry.) The nature of chemical energy storage is considerably more subtle. It also 

takes energy to pull two bonded atoms apart and thereby break a bond. In combustion of 

wood, for instance, it takes energy to break the carbon-carbon (C-C) and carbon-

hydrogen (C-H) bonds. However, the formation of the combustion products of carbon 

dioxide and water involves forming very strong carbon-oxygen (C-O) and oxygen-

hydrogen (O-H) bonds. The energy released on the formation of the C-O and O-H bonds 

is much larger than the energy needed to break the C-C and C-H bonds, so there is a net 

release of energy. Chemical energy storage then operates by forming weak bonds that can 

later be exchanged for strong bonds. 

The motion of chemical systems brings in another challenging issue of scale. 

Microscopic motions occur on time scales that are beyond the realm of everyday 

experience. For instance, it takes about 10-14 seconds for a bond to vibrate, corresponding 

to 1014 vibrations each second. Rotations are about 100 times slower, which is still 

outside the realm of everyday experience. However, an intuitive notion can be developed 

for relative time scales(cid:151)in the time it takes a molecule to go through one full rotation, its 

bonds vibrate 100 times. Similarly, in the time it takes for a bond to vibrate once, the 

electrons will have orbited tens of times.  

The framework developed for describing flow of energy in a system are powerful 

resources in the construction of explanations. For instance, this resource allows the 

release of heat during combustion to be linked to structural notions of bond strengths. 

Free energy enables predictions of whether a process can occur. Activation energy 

connects energetics the speed at which a transformation occurs. Motion is also important 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 22 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

in explanations. For instance, motion is essential for understanding the proclivity of a gas 

to fill the available volume or the fluid nature of the liquid state. 

In chemical analysis energy is often a target of the analysis but is rarely a useful 

tool for performing an analysis. For instance, analysis may reveal the energy given off by 

a reaction and so help characterize the potential of a material to act as a fuel or energy 

storage material. However, measurements of the energy are rarely used to identify an 

unknown substance.  Motion, on the other hand, is one of the most powerful tools of 

modern chemical analysis since it can be directly detected by light through spectroscopy. 

For instance, functional groups have specific frequencies at which their bonds vibrate and 

these can be detected with infrared spectroscopy. These frequencies then serve as 

fingerprints for identifying the presence of that functional group in a molecule, 

supporting molecular structure determination (qualitative analysis). The amount of light 

absorbed gives information on the amount of the molecule that is present (quantitative 

analysis). 

In chemical design energy may be an important target as in the creation of energy 

storage materials for batteries. Energy also plays into the design process. For instance, 

bond strength considerations can help determine whether a certain structure is likely to be 

stable. Free energy considerations can help determine whether a transformation needed to 

create the desired material is indeed possible. Design may also pay attention to the 

motions occurring in the material to achieve certain desired properties. For instance, in 

liquid crystal displays (LCDs) some molecular motions are designed to be liquid-like 

while others are designed to be solid-like.

Heat is one of the best instantiations of chemical energy since it is so much a part 

of our everyday experience. Chemical combustion is our primary source of heat and 

energy generation. We are also concerned with removing heat from a system whether it is 

the state change of a liquid to a gas as in the way in which air conditioners usually work 

or by melting ice to cool a glass of water. Chemical bonds mediate energy flow in the 

biosphere, with animals consuming the hydrocarbons and gain energy through controlled 

combustion (calories!) releasing CO2 in water that plants later combine with sunlight and 

water. These examples provide a base from which to nourish a student(cid:146)s understanding of 

the interplay of energy and heat in chemical systems. 

The national and state standards emphasize the significance of energy and the 

specific ideas around heat, flow and reaction. The standards seem to emphasize a series 

of specific pieces of knowledge without the functionality and sense of role that we have 

tried to provide.  In middle school the emphasis is measuring quantities associated with 

energy and energy transfer. In High School the emphasis is on linking phases of matter 

with the appropriate kinetic and molecular theories.  The work on the development of the 

resource associated with energy and motion described here connects to the following 

standards most directly. (Middle School: California Grade 8 3d,e, 5c; Colorado 5-8 2.2,

A Concluding Example 

We think that our analysis of three of the conceptual resources and the scientific 

activities of chemists allows us to consider the nature of activities that might be of use in 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 24

the classroom.  We start with some assumptions.  First, students have intuitions that can 

be stretched, molded, and built upon that are useful in developing these resources 

(Schwartz & Martin, 2004).  Second, one task of instruction is to share with the student 

the ways in which the chemists problematize the world around them and a good approach 

to doing that is to make use of observed, or observable familiar phenomenon (Lehrer & 

Schauble, 2004). Third, by starting with something simple and yet provocative we can 

(cid:145)hang onto(cid:146) a few examples that are revisited over the grades we can both make the ideas 

more subtle and complex and develop and increasingly sophisticated notion of agency.  

In the example that follows we emphasize building up the conceptual resource of 

structure and shape in order to engage in the activities of explaining, synthesizing, and 

analyzing. 

Real and Wet. Water and oil provide a setting from which to explore chemical 

structure and physical transformations. For example, comparing the states of the pure 

substances gives a sense of their underlying structure. Frozen water is a hard crystalline 

solid while frozen oil is a more plastic solid. This can be understood in terms of water 

being a small molecule that solidifies with a well-defined structure while oil consists of 

flexible chain molecules that solidify by collapsing into a spaghetti-like mass. The 

molecular structure is reflected also when water and oil are liquid, with the chain 

structure of oil leading to a more viscous liquid than water. Finally, oil vaporizes at a 

higher temperature than water because the larger size of the molecules requires more heat 

energy to launch them into the gas phase than is needed for the smaller water molecule.  

Addition of a salt lowers the freezing point of water and raises its boiling point.  

These colligative properties can also be understood at a molecular level. The salt 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 25 

 
 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

interferes with the formation of the ice lattice, lowering the temperature at which the 

lattice begins to form. The interaction between salt and water is stronger than that 

between water itself, so salt makes it harder for water to break free from the liquid into 

the gas phase. This accounts for salt raising the boiling point. 

The solubility of other molecules in water versus oil provides an opportunity for 

students to use notions of structure to make predictions and explain. That oil and water 

do not mix gives insight into the fundamental rule of solubility: like likes like. Oil and 

water are very different structurally and so do not mix. Substances will be soluble in 

liquids that are structurally similar. Sugar, with its many O-H bonds, is structurally 

similar to water and so dissolves preferentially in water. If sugar is shaken in a mixture of 

water and oil, it will choose to reside in the water layer. Capsin, the substance that makes 

red pepper, is structurally more similar to oil than water and so, when shaken in a bottle 

containing both oil and water, it will choose to reside in the oil layer. Ideally, we can 

identify a number of substances that dissolve in oil or in water to various degrees, so that 

the partitioning between the oil and water layers is easily visualized. 

The difference in solubility between oil and water provides a powerful means for 

separating molecules. In the chemical technique named extraction, a substance is shaken 

in a container with water and oil, or any other two immiscible solvents. In this manner, 

the oil soluble substances can be (cid:147)extracted(cid:148) from the mixture by pouring off the oil layer 

and leaving the water soluble substances behind. This technique would allow students to 

use structural principles as resource for analyzing samples, for instance, by separating 

the salt from the oil in a puree of potato chips. Such separation are also a common

process in chemical synthesis, allowing one to, for instance, extract or caffeine from tea 

or coffee. 

The resources developed through activities relating to solubility can be brought to 

bear on explaining the mechanism of soap or the nature of biological membranes. Both 

rely on phospholipids, molecules that have a water-loving head attached to an oil-loving 

tail. Soap washes away substances that aren(cid:146)t usually soluble in water because the 

phospholipids arrange themselves in a sphere with their heads pointing into the water and 

their tails pointing inside the sphere to form an oil environment in which the dirt is 

soluble. These spheres are referred to as micelles. Reverse micelles make water soluble 

substances soluble in oil by pointing their tails out into the oil and their heads into the 

solute. A biological membrane is formed by making a double layer, with the heads 

pointing both outside the cell and inside the cell, such that the inside of the membrane 

consists of tails arranged end to end.  

Virtual and Dry. There is enormous power, we believe, in using an apparently 

simple set of circumstances as the basis for a real investigation that can be developed 

over a long time and with increasing levels of sophistication as is the case with water and 

oil.  However, the issue of the conceptual difficulty posed by moving from the 

microscopic reality which is unseeable and mysterious to the macroscopic visible one 

remains.  The location of action in chemistry is molecular and the location of observation 

is molar. 

Computer simulations may help overcome some of the conceptual challenges in 

connecting the microscopic to the macroscopic. As discussed earlier, this connection is 

difficult not only because of the large changes in scale, but because of the indirect means 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 27 

 
 
 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

through which structure manifests at the macroscopic level and the lack of a direct means 

to manipulate and visualize the microscopic. A number of tools exist for visualizing 

molecular structure. Such tools can make the three dimensional structure of molecules 

quite vivid and are perhaps the best way to convey the immense complexity of a 

biological molecule such as hemoglobin. However, such visualizations leave the student 

in the microscopic scale and do not help bridge to the macroscopic. 

Simulations can also provide animated images of molecular motion. For instance, 

simulators are available that show the molecules of a gas moving quickly through space 

and colliding with each other and the walls of the container. Students can control 

variables such as the temperature, allowing an exploration of the effects of temperature 

on molecular motion. These simulations also allow the connection between motion and 

macroscopic properties to be developed. For instance, the pressure of the gas can be 

connected to the collisions of the molecules with the walls of the container. The rate of 

reactions can also be partially understood in terms of the frequency with which two 

molecules collide and so have the opportunity to react. One can envision extending these 

simulations to include physical transformations such as the melting of ice or boiling of 

water. 

The ideal simulation would be one that provided a learning environment in which 

students develop and use the resources of structure, transformation, and energy to 

pursue explain, analysis and design activities. The development of such an environment 

is by no means obvious. To build notions of structure, a desirable feature is the ability to 

directly manipulate molecular structure and see its macroscopic consequences. The 

challenge is that the connection between structure and properties is an unachieved target 

Yaron, Leinhardt and Karabinos 

                          Page 28 

 
SCALE Chemistry Concept Paper, 2004 

of modern chemistry and so can not yet be simulated in a general manner. Plastics may 

provide an opportunity for a limited simulation in which the structural diversity resulting 

from choice of monomer, molecular chain length, and degree of cross linking is 

sufficiently narrow to be amenable to a simulation while still giving students a wide 

latitude in terms of structural choice. If the simulation produced quantities such as 

density, melting point, brittleness that are of importance to construction of chairs, combs 

or other objects, then students could engage in a design process where direct 

manipulation of chemical structure is used to pursue a macroscopic goal. 

In this paper we tried to identify the key conceptual resources of chemistry and 

the ways in which they are used by chemists. We consider the resources to be broad ways 

of envisioning the microscopic world and how that world interplays with the 

macroscopic. As such, they provide overarching themes that can be introduced early to 

students and developed as students move through the curriculum.  The educational task 

that remains is not to make students into little chemists but to help them share some of 

the chemists world view.  This means that we need to find effective means of supporting 

students as they learn to problematize the world around them in ways that are familiar to 

chemists, as they develop a sense of agency or mechanism that resonates with that of the 

chemists, and as they begin to explain things in a way that is consistent with that of the 

chemist.

THE EFFECTS OF TECHNOLOGY ON STUDENT MOTIVATION AND 

ENGAGEMENT IN CLASSROOM-BASED LEARNING 

Abstract 

Technology has seen a recent widespread integration into daily life, where access to vast 

amounts of information is now available with ease. Todays generation of students has grown up 

with technology all around them in an ever-increasing manner. To create an effective 21st 

century classroom that meets the needs of the students, a modern teacher must factor a students 

motivation to learn and the effects technology has on inclusionary education. 

A technology implementation was devised to address this rising need. Research was 

completed at an urban charter school on a population of 348 at the time of technology 

intervention through data analysis. Student surveys were administered to gauge student 

perception and motivation, student individualized education plans were reviewed, and classroom 

observations were made. 

The results showed that students feel motivated through the specific use of technology in the 

classroom, whether it be for pedagogical purposes or for accommodations as required by an 

Individual Education Plan (IEP) or 504 plan. Further study can aid in updating teaching 

techniques to better support inclusionary education as well as enhancing student motivation.

Header: ABSTRACT 
Attitudes toward science are more frequently explored than attitudes toward particular 
science  subjects,  such  as  biology.  In  many  countries,  however,  biology  is  taught 
separately from other science subjects. The main aim of this investigation was to detect 
students  attitudes  towards  biology,  by  using  a  questionnaire  as  a  research  tool. 
Moreover, the partial aims were revelation of influence of gender, residence and grade 
level on the students attitudes towards biology. The sample size was created by 363 
students from lower secondary schools. The questionnaire (BAQ) consisted of 31 items 
of Likert type, divided into four dimensions (1. Biology as a school subject; 2. Informal 
education;  3.  Difficulty  and  4.  Interest  in  Biology).  In  addition,  the  influence  of 
independent  variables  was  observed  in  the  four  dimensions  mentioned  above. 
Furthermore, the correlation among dimensions was analyzed as well. Overall score in 
attitudes toward biology gained by lower secondary school students was neutral. Girls 
had more positive attitudes toward biology than boys. Mean score according to classes 
was decreasing with raising of grade level, but without statistically significant effect. 
More positive attitudes toward biology were revealed among rural students.

Header: INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, pupils and students are often more interested in fields of study like languages, law, economics, etc. 
These  professions  seem  to  be  attractive  and  appreciated  by  our  society.  Natural  sciences  are  less  popular  than 
humanities, because they are more difficult for students (Christidou 2011; Stuckey et al. 2013). Moreover, to be a 
scientist is an abstract profession, which means that for pupils and students it is hard to comprehend the purpose 
of scientific professions. Certainly, science, as well as biology as its part, is an important area of human progress 
and development, especially biology, which is focused on living organisms, can introduce important findings (e.g. 
in  relation  with  diseases  and  their  treatment,  agriculture,  environment,  etc.).  In  order  to  maintain  progress  in 
science or increase human development, it is necessary to guarantee a sufficient amount of university graduates in 
fields of study that are in demand. Surely, it is necessary to start with motivation in primary schools. When students 
are  interested  and  motivated  in  science,  they  probably  will  focus  on  science  in  their  secondary  and  tertiary 
education (Sadler 2009). 

Below are presented research studies, which are focused on the attitudes students toward biology and authors 

presented basic research, which are aiming to determination of research aims and research questions. 

Prokop, Tuncer and Chuda (2007) conducted research on the topic of middle school students attitudes toward 
biology.  Results  showed  positive  attitudes  toward  biology.  Students  mentioned  reasons  which  improved  their 
attitudes toward biology, specifically contact with living animals and flowers. Biology was more popular among 
younger  students  than  older  ones,  and  more  among  girls  than  boys.  Results  also  showed  that  students  do  not 
consider biology important for their common lives. Approximately three-quarters of students considered biology 
one  of  easiest  subjects.  Particularly  students  of  sixth  and  ninth  grade  considered  biology  an  easy  subject  and

Vlckova et al. / The Perception of Biology by Students 

Contribution of this paper to the literature 
  The instrument presented in this study produces valid and reliable results. 
  The difference in perception of biology with respect to grade level was not statistically significant. 
  Rural students perceived biology significantly positive in comparison with urban students. 

students  of  seventh  and  eighth  grade  a  more  difficult  subject.  Teachers  and  their  characteristics  were  found  as 
significant variable. The similar results are possible to find in the study of Prokop, Prokop and Tunniclife (2007). 
Cipkova  et  al.  (2018)  declared  positive  interest  in Biology  among  majority  of students  who  prefer  direct, active 
participation in the process of knowledge acquisition through the study and exploration of living organisms as well 
as by the execution and assessment of practicals and experiments. 

Another study concentrated on attitudes toward biology and influence of high school students opinions on 
biology lessons (Trumper 2006). Author supposed that low quality of biology lessons, and negative perception and 
opinion on biology lessons, lead to more negative attitudes. In addition, author claimed that students are interested 
in topics which are connected to their lives (e.g. human body). For this reason author recommended inclusion of 
students  into  building  the  curriculum  according  to  their  interests  and  requirements.  The  field  of  opinions  on 
biology lessons and after-school activities gained low score. Results showed that attitudes toward biology are more 
positive than attitudes toward another science subjects. Girls expressed more positive attitudes toward biology in 
comparison  to  boys,  while  overall  attitude  toward  biology  was  neutral.  The  similar  results  were  found  out  by 
Zeidan and Jayoshi (2015), where girls had got significantly positive attitudes toward biology in comparison with 
boys. Authors also found out, students from rural environment had got more positive attitudes in comparison with 
students  from  urban  environment.  It  is  connected  with  the  proximity  of  the nature  related  to  rural  students.  A 
different study focused on attitudes toward biology of high school students realized in Turkey also showed that 
the overall attitude was neutral (Ekici & Hevedanli 2010). Gender was not found statistically significant (but girls 
reached higher score than boys). Statistically significant differences were revealed among students of first grade 
and  second  grade  (more  positive  attitudes  showed  second  grade  students)  and  between  first  and  third  grade 
students  (more  positive  attitudes  had  first  grade  students).  Attitudes  toward  biology  were  not  influenced  by  a 
primary school where students studied before enrolling in a high school. Study results seemed to be important 
factor  which  influences  attitudes.  Successful  students  and  students  with  average  success  had  more  positive 
attitudes toward biology than less successful students. More positive attitudes were revealed among students from 
families with lower average wage. Hussaini, Foong and Kamar (2015) found out similar results as in previous study, 
the difference in attitudes between males and females was insignificant. Authors also examined the difference in 
attitudes between science and arts students, the science students achieved statistically significant higher score. It is 
possible to find some studies, where the sample was created by university students. Also Uitto (2014) did not find 
out significant difference in the attitudes toward biology between boys and girls. Author found out overall positive 
attitudes toward biology among students. For example, Hansen and Birol (2014) found out, attitudes of students 
toward  biology  become  significantly  more  expert-like  from  the  first  year  to  the  fourth  year  of  the  program. 
Similarly, Gardner et al. (2016) found out among nonmajor biology students, that there is significant correlation 
between perception of biologists as scientists and attitudes toward biology. The similar results were examined in 
the study of Partin et al. (2011) and Partin and Haney (2012).

Header: PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 
This study contributes to revelation of attitudes toward biology of lower secondary school students. Also, the 
present  study  verifies  influence  of  independent  variables  (gender,  residence  and  grade)  to  development  of 
attitudes. If attitudes of students and their establishment and variables influencing them are known, they can be 
improved, and students can be motivated for subsequent education. It is possible to find many studies, which are 
focused on the problematic of students attitudes toward biology. The most examined variables are gender and 
grade level of students. In this study, the residence of respondents is the focus variable, which was examined and 
it is additional value of the presented study. And also, the research studies from the area of Central Europe about 
this topic are rare and we are trying to fill the gap, which is in this field of study. The Central Europe is thought in 
the context of this study as the countries of V4 (Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland). The theoretical 
background included studies, which were published in the world-known and important scientific databases. 

The main aim of the study was to find out attitudes toward biology among lower secondary school students. This 

aim was developed by partial aims: 

1.  To find out influence of gender. 

2.  To determine influence of grade level. 

3.  To enquire influence of residence.

The research questions were established on the base of partial aims. The research questions were following: 

1.  Does the gender influence students attitudes to biology? 

2.  Are attitudes to biology influenced by grade level? 

3.  Is there any difference between attitudes of rural and urban students?

Header: METHODS 
Research Tool 

Research tool was questionnaire called Biology Attitudes Questionnaire (BAQ) consisting of two parts. First, 
there were demographic items (gender, residence, grade level and favourite subject). Second part concentrated on 
attitudes toward biology, and it included 5-scale Likert type items. The authors of the research were inspired of the 
other studies, where instrument regarding to attitudes toward biology was used (Prokop, Prokop & Tunnicliffe 
2007), some of the items were used with the permission of authors and some of the items were new. This was the 
reason why the pilot study was realized. Research tool was verified in the pilot study. According to the results of 
the  pilot  research  and  according  results  of  confirm  factor  analysis,  research  tool  was  adjusted.  First  version  of 
questionnaire  included  39  items  from  which  8  items  were  eliminated  in  total  (see  subchapter  Data  analysis). 
Finally, second part of research tool consisted of 31 items. Overall, 18 items were constructed in positive meaning 
and 13 items in negative meaning. These 31 items were divided into 4 dimensions (detailed information is presented 
in subchapter Data analysis). 

Respondents 

In  total,  363  respondents  from  5  lower  secondary  schools  answered  the  questionnaire.  The  schools  were 
traditional without any alternative form of education. The non-probability methods of sampling were used, but the 
sample size was appropriate to use statistical methods and to suggest the conclusions. The age of respondents was 
between 11  16 years. Distribution of respondents according to demographic items is presented in Table 1. 

Data Analysis 

Research tool was administered to five lower secondary schools, specifically, three of them were situated in a 
city and two of them were situated in a village. In this place is needed to write, in case of schools in the urban 
schools (cities > 5.000 inhabitants)  then village mentioned later should be less than 5.000 inhabitants. In case of 
schools in the city, authors of this paper administered research tool. In case of the village schools, research tool was 
administered  by  teachers,  who  were  instructed  about  method  of  assignation  of  research  tool  to  students.  All 
respondents  were  informed  about  anonymity  of  the  research.  Students  had  unlimited  time  for  completing  the 
questionnaire, however, completing the research questions took from 10 to 20 minutes. 

Demographic items were determined as independent variables for data analysis. Contrarily, second part of the 
research tool consisting of Likert type items was determined as dependent variable. Items with positive meaning 
were coded from 1 (absolutely disagree) to 5 (absolutely agree), items in negative meaning were coded reversely. 
Lower score reached in questionnaire indicated negative attitudes, higher score indicated positive attitudes.

Figure 1. Attitudes toward biology with respect to favourite subject 

Reliability of research tool was determined by using Cronbach alpha ( = 0.92), which indicated high reliability 
of the research tool (Nunnally 1987). Reliability was ascertained for all dimensions separately, and results indicated 
reliability  ranged  between  0.54  and  0.92.  Besides,  content  validity  was  determined  by  verifying  influence  of 
favourite subject on attitudes toward biology. Statistically significant difference was determined in independent 
variable  favourite  subject  (score  reached  in  humanities:  2.80,  technical  subjects  2.91,  art  and  physical  3.15  and 
science subject 3.55). These findings contributed to the validity of research tool. Figure 1 presents reached score 
according to favourite subject. 

Kolmogor-Smirnov test was applicated for verifying suitability of statistic methods, its results indicated normal 

distribution of data (d = 0.04; p > 0.20). These results allowed to apply parametric statistic methods. 

Confirmatory  factor  analysis was  used  for  substantiating  distribution  of  items  into  dimensions  and  also  for 
verifying appropriateness of items. Research tool was rearranged to better utilisation for identification of attitudes 
toward biology of lower secondary school students on the base of results of this test. Appropriateness of factor 
analysis was determined by Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and Bartlett test of sphericity. Result of KMO test was 0.93 
and result of Bartlett test was 2 = 6097.27; p < 0.001. These results indicated aptness of factor analysis.  

Data in numeric form were examined by confirmatory factor analysis with Varimax rotation, which ascertained 
4 dimensions with eigenvalue higher than 1.00. Results of factor analysis are provided in Table 2. First dimension 
was  Biology  as  a  school  subject  and  there  were  15  items,  for  instance  item  number  19  was  included  in  this 
dimension (I am looking forward to biology lessons). Second dimension included 9 items and it was labelled as 
Informal  education.  An  example  of  this  dimension  is  item  number  23  (I  enjoy  biology  films  on  TV).  Thirdly, 
dimension Difficulty was established. This dimension contained 4 items, and example of this dimension is item 
number  13  (Biology  lessons  are  demanding  for  me).  Last  dimension  was  Interest  and  there  were  3  items,  for 
instance item number 37 (We do not use any tools during biology lessons). These dimensions explained 45.16 % of 
overall variance, more specifically, majority of it was explained by dimension 1 (23.53 %). The distribution of items 
into dimensions was supported by the previous results published in research studies (Prokop, Prokop & Tunnicliffe 
2007; Prokop, Tuncer & Chuda 2007) and the distribution of items into dimension was confirmed by the results of 
exploratory factor analysis. In total, 8 items were deleted from final version of research tool. The criterion for the 
elimination of 8 items was value of factor loading score, the margin value was 0.40, which is suggested value for 
the elimination of items (Velicer & Fava 1998).

For  determining  statistical  significant  differences  according  to  independent  variables  were  used  tests  of 
inductive statistics, especially analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. Demographic items were considered to 
be independent variables and Likert type items were considered to be dependent variables. Pair-wise comparisons 
were  made  with  Fisher  LSD  post-hoc  test.  Relationships  among  dimensions  were  ascertained  by  Pearsons 
correlational coefficient. The Cohens d was used for the determination of the effect size.

Header: RESULTS 
Overall attitude score (x = 2.98) indicated neutral attitude of students toward biology. Statistically significant 
difference in attitudes toward biology was discovered between girls and boys (F = 8.13, p  0.05, d = 0.92). Results 
showed that girls had more positive attitudes than boys (Figure 2). Mean score and standard errors are presented 
in Table 3. 

Analysis of variance revealed statistically significant difference in case of independent variable grade (F = 6.14, 
p    0.05,  d  =  1.11).  Fishers  LSD  post-hoc  test  uncovered  more  positive  attitudes  of  students  of  sixth  grade  in 
comparison with students of eighth and ninth grade. Next, results showed more positive attitudes of students of 
seventh grade than students of ninth grade. Statistically significant difference was uncovered between students of 
eighth  and  ninth  grade,  specifically  younger  students  had  more  positive  attitudes.  The  highest  score  gained 
students of sixth grade, on the contrary students of ninth grade gained the lowest score. These results are provided 
on Figure 3. Gained mean score and standard errors are presented in Table 3.

In  first  dimension  Biology  as  a  school  subject  statistically  significant  differences  were  affirmed  in  all 
independent variables. More positive attitudes toward biology expressed rural students than urban students (F = 
5.64, p  0.05, d = 0.84). Further, girls showed more positive attitudes than boys (F = 8.38, p  0.05). Finally, Fishers 
LSD post-hoc test revealed significant differences between students of sixth grade and students of all other grades, 
also significant difference was between students of seventh grade and students of ninth grade level (F = 6.14, p  
0.05, d = 0.86).  

Turning  now  to  second  dimension  Informal  education  analysis  of  variance  detected  statistically  significant 
differences according to independent variable gender (F = 14.14, p  0.05, d = 1.02) and grade ( F = 8.32, p  0.05, d 
= 1.14). In particular, girls had more positive attitudes than boys. Further, significant differences were revealed 
between students of sixth grade and students of eighth and ninth grade. Next, significant difference was detected 
between  students  of  seventh grade  and  students  of  eighth and  ninth  grade.  Each  of  these  results  showed  more 
positive attitudes of younger students. Residence of students was explored to be statistically significant variable in 
this dimension (F = 2.84, p  0.05, d = 0.91). 

Regarding  to  third  dimension  Difficulty  independent  variable  gender  was  determined  to  be  statistically 
significant (F = 5.04, p  0.05; d = 0.98). Girls showed more positive attitudes. Independent variables residence (F = 
2.37, p = 0.12, d = 0.91) and grade level (F = 2.29, p = 0.08; d = 1.13) did not have significant influence on attitudes 
toward biology. 

In terms of dimension Interest all independent variables were statistically significant. Specifically, analysis of 
influence of variable residence (F = 4.92, p  0.05, d = 0.95) revealed more positive attitudes of rural students than 
urban students. Focusing on variable gender (F = 8.01, p  0.05, d = 0.89) girls showed more positive attitudes than 
boys. Further, Fishers LSD post-hoc test was applicate on variable grade (F = 9.12, p  0.05, d = 1.06) and results 
showed more positive attitudes of sixth grade students in comparison with eighth and ninth grade students. Also, 
students of seventh grade showed more positive attitudes than students of eighth and ninth grade. 

Relationships between Dimensions 

Influence of each dimension to other dimensions was determined as well. Apart from dimension Difficulty 
and dimension Interest there was identified positive influence of all dimensions mutually. Results of Pearsons 
relationships  coefficient  are  provided  in  Table  6.  The  most  positive  correlation  to  other  dimensions  expressed 
dimension Biology as a school subject. The strongest relationship was discovered between dimensions Biology as 
a  school  subject  and  Informal  education.  Further,  Pearsons  relationships  coefficient  ascertained  relationship 
between  dimensions  Biology  as  a  school  subject  and  dimension  Interest.  As  for  relationship  of  dimensions 
Informal  education  and  Interest  there  was  detected  weaker  relationship  between  them.  Detailed  results  of 
relationship among dimension are presented in Table 6.

Header: DISCUSSION 
This  study  was  concerning  on  attitudes  determination  of  lower  secondary  school  students  toward  biology. 
Overall score in attitudes toward biology gained by lower secondary school students was neutral. Similar results 
discovered on high school students Trumper (2006) and Ekici and Hevedanli (2010), furthermore Usak et al. (2009a, 
b) identified neutral attitudes toward biology on his study conducted on university students. Conversely, positive 
attitudes toward biology were identified in research conducted on primary schools by Prokop, Tuncer & Chuda 
(2007). Although, attitudes toward biology are not always positive, negative attitudes were not identified in none 
of the studies mentioned above. Curriculum of biology include a huge range of study stuff, abiotic nature on the 
one side, across microorganisms and bacteria, continuing with flowers and animals, and biology of human on the 
other side. On the one hand, biology during solving its problems needs synthesis and gathering information from 
various fields of science together (for instance solving problems connected with ecosystems). On the other hand, 
biology analyse phenomenon and processes to gain profound information (for instance genetics). This huge range 
of stuff included into biology allow to both pupils and students choose personally interesting and favourable topics, 
unfortunately the same reason leads to possibility to choose personally tedious and unpopular topics. Therefore, 
neutral attitudes toward biology can appear often. 

Girls  had  more  positive  attitudes  toward  biology  than  boys.  This  result  is  consistent  with  results  of  study 
conducted  on  lower  secondary  schools  by  Prokop,  Prokop  and  Tunnicliffe  (2007)  and  also  Prokop,  Tuncer  and 
Chuda (2007). Besides, some previous studies conducted on high schools are in line with this result (specifically, 
Trumper 2006; Zeidan 2010). Although, this result differs from some published studies on high schools (especially, 
Ekici  &  Hevedanli  2010)  and  on  universities  (especially,  Usak  et  al.  2009b)  where  gender  was  not  identified  as 
statistically significant variable for influencing attitudes toward biology. Altogether, it can therefore be assumed 
that gender is important factor for attitudes toward biology. Some authors attempted to explain reasons for arising 
of differences in attitudes toward biology between girls and boys. Baker and Leary (1995) declared assumption that 
girls like biology quite a lot, in contrast their surroundings do not consider science subjects as appropriate for girls 
and  their  employment  in  future  and  this  can  subsequently  leads  toward  more  negative  attitudes  to  biology. 
Moreover,  authors  described  more  negative  attitudes  of  girls  toward  physic  and  chemistry  in  comparison with 
biology.  According  to  these  authors,  a  possible  explanation  for  this  might  be  that  girls  cannot  see  in  this  less 
favourable  subject  connection  with  human  body  and  taking  care  about  other  people  which  is  interesting  and 
appealing for girls. Girls had opposite point of view in biology, this lead toward more positive attitudes of girls 
than  boys,  who  consider  different  topics  of  science  subjects  to  be  interesting.  Jones,  Howe  and  Rua  (2000) 
ascertained differences between boys and girls in attitudes according to activities practised in biology lessons. Boys 
fulfil experiments with bacteria or chemicals, oppositely girls preferred activities connected with taking care about 
human body (these activities are more typical for biology than chemistry or physics).  

Second research question was focused on the change of attitudes toward biology with respect to grade level of 
students. Mean score according to classes was really decreasing with raising of grade level. But these changes were 
not statistically significant so often. More positive attitudes among younger students detected Prokop, Prokop and 
Tunnicliffe (2007) and also Prokop, Tuncer and Chuda (2007). Trumper (2006) claimed that students showed bigger 
interest in relation with topics closed to their lives (e.g. human biology). This topic is taught in eighth grade in 
country,  where  this  study  was  conducted.  It  seems  that  students  of  eighth  grade  in  our  study  will  show  more 
positive attitudes toward biology than other grade levels. This statement was not confirmed. Students of eighth 
level gained higher score just than students of ninth grade. Nonetheless, authors conducted research on secondary 
schools, where concentration of students is more specific. The lowest score was identified among students of ninth 
grade, which is probably caused by unattractive topic inanimate nature. Result can be influenced by close end of 
students studies on lower secondary school and making decision about future studies. In this case, students can 
consider biology to be less important than other subjects. Contrarily, highest score reached students of sixth grade 
level (there was statistically significant difference compared to higher grade levels). This result can be caused by 
more playful education style on lower grade levels.  

Third  research  question  was  regarding  to  find  out  difference  in  attitudes  toward  biology  with  respect  to 
residence  of  respondents.  More  positive  attitudes  toward  biology  were  revealed  among  rural  students.  Zeidan 
(2010)  ascertained  influence  of  residence  on  attitudes  toward  biology.  His  results  did  not  revealed  statistically 
significant  influence  of  this  independent  variable.  The  similar  results  were  examined  by  the  Babu  and 
Govindharajan (2014). Zeidan and Jayoshi (2015) found out statistically better attitudes toward biology among rural 
students; this result is in concordance with our findings. The biology curriculum consists of topics such as Botany, 
Zoology, Ecology and others, which are connected with the environment and it can cause higher interest about the 
biology as subject and it is connected with better attitudes toward biology. The similar statement is possible to find 
in the study of Ihuoma (2017). 

Influence of independent variable was examined for dimensions. Important factor changing attitudes toward 
biology  was  gender.  Girls  showed  more  positive  attitudes  toward  biology  in  overall  result  and  in  all  four 

9 / 12 

 
 
 
 
Vlckova et al. / The Perception of Biology by Students 

dimensions. Statistically significant influence on dimensions showed independent variable residence. Statistically 
significant  differences  were  detected  among  all  dimensions  except  Difficulty.  Influence  of  class  according  to 
dimensions I overall score revealed differences between students of sixth grade level and eighth grade level, next 
between students of sixth grade level and ninth grade level. Difference according to grade level was not detected 
only in dimension Difficulty. 

Individual  dimensions  usually  correlated  positively.  The  strongest  relationship  was  between  dimensions 
Biology as a school subject and Informal education. It seems obvious that students concerning on activities 
connected with biology in their leisure time percept biology lesson more positive. Strong relationship was detected 
between  dimensions  Biology  as  school  subject  and  Interest.  These  results  indicated  that  huger  interest  in 
biology, bigger concern in biology lessons. Dimensions Informal education and Interest correlated positively 
too. If students practice activities connected with biology in their leisure time, they express bigger interest toward 
biology.  Next,  positive  correlation  was  between  dimensions  Biology  as  a  school  subject  and  Difficulty. 
Increasing  difficulty  in  biology  leads  to  more  negative  perception  of  biology.  If  teachers  do  not  relieve  biology 
lessons by interesting things, videos and other less demanding activities, than students will consider biology more 
difficulty.  Moreover,  dimensions  Informal  education  and  Difficulty  collated  positively.  More  activities  in 
leisure time connected with biology, less difficult point of view on biology lessons. From all results arise eminent 
influence of difficulty on attitudes toward biology.

############################# SECTION END #####################################
Header: CONCLUSION 
On the basis of results, there are some areas, which could be adapted in the learning process of biology and they 

could influence students attitudes toward biology in the positive way. 

Modern technologies are more frequent in school lessons nowadays. Its influence on biology education and 
attitudes toward biology was not acquired in our study. Kara and Yesilyurt (2007) on base of their results claim 
that students taught by modern technologies showed more positive attitudes toward biology. These students also 
gained better results in the test focusing on misconceptions in particular part of biology. Movahedzadeh (2011) on 
base of results of his study recommended school subject taught by e-learning. Students using e-learning express 
more contentment and they reached better results. Studies mentioned above were conducted on higher levels of 
education. Similar results can be expected on primary school too. PCs, tablets, interactive boards and other modern 
technologies are more frequent nowadays in common life. Students have to learn how effectively use these tools. If 
using of these tools lead to better, more effective, more interesting education or positive attitudes, teachers should 
bring them to lessons and use them. The similar suggestion was possible to find out in other studies e.g. Weng et 
al (2019). 

Teachers should try to present schoolwork as close stuff which is interconnect with their everyday life. Another 
way how to develop positive attitudes toward biology can be using modern technologies during school education. 
Significant  difference  was  detected  between  boys  and  girls  and  between  rural  students  and  urban  students. 
Teachers should systematically work on balancing these differencing and raising attitudes of weaker groups. The 
teachers could use the inquiry-based methods of teaching. Many studies quoted, that this method is very effective 
in the understating of the curriculum and also it can be a very important thing to improve attitudes toward biology 
(Aktamis, Higde & Ozden 2016; Tessie, 2010; Veloo, Perumal & Vikneswary 2013). The inquiry-based methods of 
teaching  is  approaching  the  curriculum  of  biology  for  students  and  they  have  got  a  direct  contact  with  many 
biological  phenomenon  and  it  can  improve  the  attitudes  toward  biology  (Orazem  &  Tomazic  2018;  Tomazic  & 
Sorgo  2017;  Torkar  et  al.  2010).  Also  the  using  of  innovative  teaching  methods  like  active-learning  pedagogies, 
consistent formative assessment or cooperative group could lead to improving of attitudes toward biology. These 
methods were mentioned as effective in some studies like Connell, Donovan and Chambers (2016) and Taraban et 
al. (2007). 

Other possibility how to improve students attitudes toward biology is to incorporate the elements of informal 
learning. Informal science learning experiences such as doing science activities at home or going to out-of school 
programmes/clubs, visiting a science museum, and playing in nature are essential to advance students science 
abilities and attitude (Henriksen, Jensen & Sjaastad 2015; Lin & Schunn 2016). On the other side, the application of 
informal learning activities should not be oversized, as Yoon et al. (2013) mentioned the excessive incorporation of 
informal learning activities could lead into decreasing of attitudes toward subject, where informal learning was 
applicate. 

Considering current state of literature and results of this study realisation of similar researches are demanded. 
One of the possible important researches would be the focus on the examining of negative factors, which could 
create barriers in the improving of attitudes. This study tried to fill empty place in this field of research. There are 
still a lot of themes which should be acquired in depth.

Header: ABSTRACT
A  substantial  amount  of  money  is  spent  on  technology  by  schools,  families  and  policymakers 
with  the  hope  of  improving  educational  outcomes.  This  paper  explores  the  theoretical  and 
empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses 
on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: i) classroom 
use  in  schools,  and  ii)  home  use  by  students.  Theoretically,  ICT  investment  and  CAI  use  by 
schools  and  the  use  of  computers  at  home  have  ambiguous  implications  for  educational 
achievement: expenditures devoted to  technology  necessarily offset  inputs  that may  be  more  or 
less  efficient,  and  time  allocated  to  using  technology  may  displace  traditional  classroom 
instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling 
literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional 
class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools 
produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in 
studies  of  developing  countries  and  CAI  interventions  that  target  math  rather  than  language.  In 
the  context  of  home  use,  early  studies  based  on  multivariate  and  instrumental  variables 
approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies 
based  on  randomized  control  experiments  tend  to  find  small  or  null  effects.  Early  research 
focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in 
developing countries.

Schools  and  families  around  the  world  spend  a  substantial  amount  of  money  on 

computers,  software,  Internet  connections,  and  other  technology  for  educational  purposes.  The 

use  of  technology  is  ubiquitous  in  the  educational  system  in  most  developed  countries.  For 

example,  essentially  all  instructional  classrooms  in  U.S.  public  schools  have  computers  with 

Internet access (U.S. Department of Education 2012). Most countries in Europe also have high 

rates  of  computer  access  in  schools  (European  Commission  2013).  In  addition  to  school  level 

investment  in  technology,  central  governments  frequently  play  an  active  role  in  providing  or 

subsidizing  investment  in  computer  and  Internet  access.  The  U.S.  federal  government  spends 

more than $2 billion and recently increased the spending cap to $3.9 billion per year on the E-

rate  program,  which  provides  discounts 

to  schools  and 

libraries  for 

the  costs  of 

telecommunications  services  and  equipment  (Puma,  et  al.  2000,  Universal  Services 

Administration Company 2013, Federal Communications Commission 2014). England provided 

free computers to nearly 300,000 low-income families at a total cost of 194 million through the 

Home  Access  Programme.1  A  growing  number  of  schools  are  experimenting  with  one-to-one 

laptop or tablet programs that provide a computer to each student and often allow the student to 

take  the  computer  home  (Warschauer  2006;  Maine  Education  Policy  Research  Institute  2007; 

Texas Center for Educational Research 2009).2 These programs are potentially expensive -- for 

example,  equipping  each  of  the  50  million  public  school  students  in  the  United  States  with  a 

1 The Euro 200 Program in Romania and the Yo Elijo Mi PC Program in Chile are additional examples of 
government programs providing computers to low-income children. 
2 Extensive efforts to provide laptops to schoolchildren also exist in many developing countries. For 
example, the One Laptop per Child program has provided more than 2 million computers to schools in 
Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, Mexico and Rwanda, and started new projects in Gaza, Afghanistan, Haiti, 
Ethiopia and Mongolia. See http://one.laptop.org/about/countries.

laptop would cost tens of billions of dollars each year even if these laptops were replaced only 

every three years. 

Families also spend a substantial amount of money on computers, software, and Internet 

connections  each  year.  In  the  United  States,  for  example,  86  percent  of  schoolchildren  have 

access to a computer at home. Although current levels of access to home computers and Internet 

connections  among  schoolchildren  are  very  high,  access  is  not  evenly  distributed  across 

countries  or  across  the  population  within  countries.  Less  than  one  quarter  of  schoolchildren  in 

Indonesia, for example, have access to a computer at home that they can use for schoolwork. In 

the United States, 98 percent of the 12 million schoolchildren living in households with $100,000 

or  more  in  income  have  access  to  a  computer  at  home,  but  only  67  percent  of  the  12  million 

schoolchildren  living  in  households  with  less  than  $25,000  in  income  have  access.  These 

disparities in access to home computers and the Internet are known as the Digital Divide. 

A  better  understanding  of  how  computer  technology  affects  educational  outcomes  is 

critical because it sheds light on whether such technology is an important input in the educational 

production  process  and  whether  disparities  in  access  will  translate  into  educational  inequality. 

This  paper  explores  the  theory  and  literature  on  the  impacts  of  technology  on  educational 

outcomes. Although technology is a broad term, the paper focuses on the effects of computers, 

the  Internet,  and  software  such  as  computer  assisted  instruction,  which  are  currently  the  most 

relevant forms of new technology in education.3 The discussion focuses primarily on the impacts 

of  computers,  the  Internet  and  software  on  educational  outcomes  instead  of  impacts  on  other 

forms  of  human  capital  such  as  computer  skills  (although  we  discuss  a  few  studies).4  We 

3 The Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics define personal computers as "desktop, laptop, 
netbook, notebook or tablet computers" in the latest Current Population Survey (2012). 
4 Computer skills training (CST) or computer science, which are vocational or academic subjects with 
benefits in the labor market, have generally been of less interest in the area of the economics of education.

consider  studies  that  examine  the  impacts  of  technology  on  measurable  educational  outcomes, 

such  as  grades,  test  scores,  retention,  graduation,  and  attendance.  Attention  is  also  largely,  but 

not entirely, restricted to studies from the economics literature. 

The  literature  focuses  on  two  primary  contexts  in  which  technology  may  be  used  for 

educational purposes: i) classroom use in schools, and ii) home use by students. These contexts 

differ fundamentally in terms of who makes the investment decision and who controls how the 

technology  is  used.  Districts  and  schools  determine  the  level  of  technology  investment  and 

control how it is used  in the  classroom to aid instruction. Parents and  students make decisions 

over  investment  in  computers,  the  Internet,  software,  and  other  technologies  at  home.  One 

unifying  theme  of  the  discussion  is  that  the  use  of  technology  is  placed  in  the  context  of 

educational production functions commonly discussed in the economics literature. 

Investment in computer hardware, software and connectivity may offset other inputs that 

affect student achievement in the context of the household and the school. Likewise, time spent 

using  computers  offsets  other  educational  or  recreational  activities.  We  discuss  the  extent  to 

which the estimates in the literature reflect these tradeoffs. Investment in computers for schools 

is divided into two broad areas: i) investment in information and communications technologies 

(ICT) generally, such as computer hardware and Internet connections, and ii) specific software 

used for computer aided instruction (CAI). Computer use at home poses a unique challenge for 

estimation  as  the  context  is  less  conducive  to  policy  interventions  and  randomized  trials.  We 

Angrist and Lavy (2002) note that CST skills seems undeniably useful, just as typing was a useful skill 
taught in American high schools earlier in the twentieth century, but most of the recent interest in the 
educational use of computers focuses on CAI and not CST. We also do not focus on the analysis of the 
relationship between technology and the labor market for which there has been an extensive literature.

2. Technology Use in Schools 

2.1 Estimates of rates of technology use in schools 

Access to computers in public schools has increased manifold in the last thirty years. In 

the United States, there were only 0.008 computers per student in 1984, or 1 computer per 125 

students  (Coley,  Cadler,  and  Engel  1997).  Figure  1  displays  recent  trends  in  the  number  of 

computers per student based on data from the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES). 

As recently as 1998, there were 0.15 computers per student and only half of these computers had 

Internet  access.  The  most  recent  data  available  from  the  NCES,  which  is  from  2008,  indicates 

that there are 0.32 computers per student and essentially all computers have Internet access.  

Germany, the UK, Japan, and other OECD countries also have high levels of computer 

access. Table 1 reports the average number of computers available per student for the 50 most 

populous  countries  in  the  world  with  data  reported  in  the  2012  Programme  for  International 

Student  Assessment  (PISA)  conducted  by  the  OECD.  These  data  indicate  that  there  are  0.95 

computers per 15  year-old  student in  the  U.S., 1.02 in  the United  Kingdom,  0.65 in  Germany, 

5 

 
 
and 0.56 in Japan. PISA data contain, to the best of our knowledge, the most uniform measure of 

computer  access  across  all  countries,  but  provide  estimates  of  the  number  of  computers  per 

student that are much higher than most other sources. For example, the PISA estimates are nearly 

three times higher for the United States than those reported by the NCES, which is likely partly 

due  to  counting  the  number  of  available  computers  to  students  of  a  specific  age,  including 

those shared with students in other grades, but is also partly due to the most recent NCES data 

being from 2008.5 

Table  2  presents  the  results  of  the  European  Commissions  survey  of  school  computer 

access and use. The survey reveals rates of computer access more similar to those in the U.S. for 

several countries, including Austria, Denmark and Spain. Across all EU countries represented in 

the study, there are 0.20 computers per student in the 8th grade and 0.33 computers per student in 

the  11th  grade.  More  than  50  percent  of  middle  school  students  in  the  EU  reported  using  a 

computer  during  lessons  at  least  once  each  week.  It  is  clear  that  the  computer  has  become  a 

regular part of classroom instruction in developed countries.6  

Interestingly,  in  the  United  States,  schools  serving  students  from  the  lowest  income 

households  have  an  almost  identical  number  of  computers  per  student  as  schools  serving 

wealthier  households  (U.S.  Department  of  Education  2012),  though  the  quality  of  these 

computers  may  differ.  However,  there  is  a  notable  digital  divide  across  countries.  Many 

developing countries still have relatively low rates of computer and Internet access. PISA reports 

5 To create their measure of computers per student, PISA uses responses to the following two questions: 
"At your school, what is the total number of students in the <national modal grade for 15-year-olds>?," 
and "Approximately, how many computers are available for these students for educational purposes?" 
This measure is different than those collected by other institutions such as the U.S. Department of 
Education, the European Commission, and UNESCO. These institutions consider the total number of 
school computers and the total number of school students. 
6 Simple counts of computers and Internet connections provide only a general sense of each countrys 
level of technology adoption. Potentially important differences in the quality of technology and the 
intensity of technology use (e.g. hours per day) are rarely documented in a systematic way.

computer  access  rates  in  Brazil,  Romania,  Turkey,  and  Vietnam  that  are  approximately  one-

fourth those in developed countries. UNESCO (2014) reports that the Philippines has more than 

400 students per computer.7 Due to a lack of uniform data over time, it is difficult to determine 

the rate at which computer access is changing in many countries and how persistent the digital 

divide is likely to be. 

2.2 Theory 

Access  to  computers  in  schools  may  improve  student  outcomes  in  several  ways.  Computer 

software has the potential to provide self-paced instruction that is typically difficult to achieve in 

group  instruction  (Koedinger  et  al.  1997).  Likewise,  the  content  of  instruction  may  be 

individualized  to  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  student.  Because  students  can  use 

instructional  programs  without  the  direct  supervision  of  a  teacher,  ICTs  and  computer  aided 

instruction hold the promise of increasing the overall amount of instruction that students receive 

(Cuban 1993 and Barrow, Markman, and Rouse 2009), while still allowing parents and teachers 

to  monitor  student  progress.  The  Internet  represents  a  potentially  valuable  resource  for  finding 

out information about a wide range of educational topics for reducing the coordination costs of 

group  projects.  Computers,  the  Internet,  software  and  other  technologies,  because  of  their 

interactive  nature,  may  engage  schoolchildren  in  ways  that  traditional  methods  cannot  (Cuban 

2003). Further, enhanced computer skills may alter the economic returns to education, especially 

in fields in which computers are used extensively. These factors, in addition to the direct benefits 

7 The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics 
has recently been tasked with improving global data on ICT availability and use (UNESCO 2009). While 
UNESCO has produced reports for several regions since 2012 (Latin America, the Caribbean, and the 
Arab States), the coverage is still quite limited.

of being computer literate in the workplace, society and higher education, are behind the decision 

to invest in ICT and CAI in schools. 

The most relevant policy question of interest is whether schools are choosing the optimal 

levels  of  technology  relative  to  traditional  inputs.  That  is,  with  limited  financial  resources  and 

instructional  time,  can  schools,  district,  states,  or  countries  increase  academic  achievement  by 

investing  more  in  technology.  The  answer  to  this  question  necessarily  involves  a  trade-off 

between  inputs.  Financial  investment  in  computers,  Internet  connections,  software  and  other 

ICTs  is  likely  to  offset  investment  in  traditional  resources  such  as  teachers  and  textbooks. 

Likewise, time spent using computers in the classroom may offset traditional group instruction 

by the teacher or independent learning by the student. These tradeoffs imply that the theoretical 

predictions of the effect of ICT and CAI investment are ambiguous.  

Computer  resources  can  be  added  to  a  standard  model  of  education  production  (for 

examples in  the literature  see  Hanushek 1979, 1986; Rivkin,  Hanushek, and  Kain 2005; Figlio 

1999;  and  Todd  and  Wolpin  2003).  The  binding  constraints  in  such  models  are  the  budget  for 

school resources  and the amount of class time available for instruction. With these constraints, 

the  comparison  of  interest  is  the  effectiveness  of  a  dollar  invested  in  ICT  relative  to  a  dollar 

invested  in  traditional  school  resources  and,  analogously,  the  effectiveness  of  an  hour  of 

classroom  time  allocated  to  CAI  relative  to  an  hour  of  traditional  instruction.  In  practice, 

however,  the  literature  frequently  estimates  the  effect  of  supplemental  investment  in  ICT  and 

supplemental  class  time  using  CAI.8  These  estimates  of  the  effect  of  ICT  and  CAI  reflect 

whether technology can have a positive effect on education in the absence of constraints. 

8 The distinction between estimates based on inputs that are supplements to, rather than substitutes for, 
traditional instruction is rarely made adequately in the literature. A notable exception is Linden (2008), 
which makes the distinction the focal point of parallel experiments  one that substitutes for traditional 
instruction with CAI and another that provides supplemental CAI outside of regular school hours.

We  consider  a  model  of  value-added  education  that  provides  a  framework  in  which  to 

discuss the empirical studies discussed in the following section.9 

(2.1) Ait=f(Xit,Ait-1,Sit,Cit,Tit

S,Tit

C)    s.t.    Pt

SSit + Pt

CCit  Bt     and     Tit

S + Tit

C  T 

A measure of academic achievement, Ait, is assumed to depend on the characteristics of a student 

and  his  or  her  family,  Xit,  prior  year  achievement,  Ait-1,  investment  in  traditional  and  computer 

resources, Sit and Cit, and time allocated to traditional and computer instruction, Tit

S and Tit

C. The 

investments Sit and Cit can be thought of as a per-student average allocation if they are not chosen 

at  the  student  level,  subject  to  prices  Pt

S  and  Pt

C  and  a  per-student  budget  Bit.  Likewise,  the 

amount  of  time  spent  on  traditional  and  computer  instruction  is  constrained  by  total  available 

instructional  time  T.  Note  that  this  model  could  also  be  considered  at  the  level  of  a  specific 

subject  of  interest.  Conversely,  if  schools  or  districts  cannot  choose  individual  specific  input 

levels, academic outcomes and inputs could be in the aggregate (e.g. the median score on a math 

exam). 

If schools choose the optimal levels of investment and time allocation, then an exogenous 

reallocation  toward  technology  will  result  in  a  negative  or  zero  effect  on  the  educational 

outcome. If schools do not make optimal choices, then the resulting change is likely to depend on 

several  factors.  Shifting  investment  to  technology  may  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  quality  of 

instruction. Greater investment in technology could improve the effectiveness of time dedicated 

to  computer-based  instruction  and  the  corresponding  reduction  in  traditional  resources  may 

reduce 

the  effectiveness  of 

time  dedicated 

to 

traditional 

instruction.  Of  course,

literature.

complementarities  between  certain  technologies  and  teacher  skills  could  offset  some  of  the 

negative  effect  on  traditional  instruction.  These  effects,  holding  the  respective  time  allocations 

fixed,  will  be  positive  if  A/C  >  A/S.  However,  schools  may  change  the  allocation  of 

instructional  time  in  response  to  the  change  in  resources.  For  example,  a  school  with  more 

computers  may  allocate  more  time  to  computer-based  instruction  and  less  to  group  instruction 

led by a teacher. Thus the total effect of changing the allocation of financial resources may also 

reflect  a  reallocation  of 

instructional 

time,  [A/C  +  A/TC*TC/C]    [A/S  + 

A/TS*TS/S]. 

This model can be extended to account for different assumptions about the allocation of 

classroom time. First, computers may increase the total amount of instruction a student receives 

if  teachers  must  divide  their  time  between  group  and  individual  instruction.  In  this  scenario, 

some  traditional  class  time,  TS,  is  wasted  for  students  and  CAI  can  fill  in  these  down  periods. 

This should cause increased investment in ICT, and CAI in particular, to be more likely to have a 

positive  effect  on  educational  outcomes.  Alternatively,  students  may  use  computers  for  non-

instructional  activities  that  offset  instructional  time.  Furthermore,  mechanical  problems  with 

technology  could  create  instructional  downtime.  That  is,  some  computer-based  instructional 

time, TC, may be wasted and thus crowd out more productive instruction. This should cause ICT 

investment to be more likely to have a negative effect. We discuss each of these adjustments to 

the model and the implications for interpreting estimates in the literature. 

Barrow,  Markman,  and  Rouse  (2009)  propose  a  model  to  argue  that  CAI  may  increase 

total instructional time during a class period or school day. They assume that a teacher j divides 

class  time  between  providing  group  instruction,  Tj

G,  and  individualized  instruction  for  each 

student  i,  Tij.  Each  student  receives  group  instruction  and  his  or  her  share  of  individual 

10 

 
instruction. Computer instruction, Ti

C, provides supplemental instruction during periods when the 

teacher  is  giving  individual  instruction  to  other  students.  This  model  differs  from  the  baseline 

model  presented  above  in  that  CAI  replaces  down  time  rather  than  traditional  instruction.  The 

revised constraints make these trade-offs clear.

The  return  to  computer-based  instruction,  A/TC,  is  not  offset  by  a  reduction  in  traditional 

instruction,  A/TS.  Modeled  in  this  way,  CAI  will  improve  academic  outcomes  if  it  provides 

any academic benefit: f(Xit,Ait-1,Tit,Tt

C)  f(Xit,Ait-1,Tit,Tt

G, 0).10 

Belo, Ferreira, and Telang (2014) model a case in which time spent using computers is 

not necessarily productive. For example, students may use computers to watch videos or engage 

in social networking activities that do not improve traditional academic outcomes. In this case, 

computer time TC is divided between learning time TL and distraction time TD. Thus the new time 

constraint is Tit

S + Tit

L + Tit

D  T. This implies that the difference in the marginal returns, A/TC 

 A/TS, depends on both the effectiveness of TL relative to TS and the share of TC that is spent 

on non-instructional activities. These two models highlight that the effects of CAI  estimated in 

the literature may stem from differences in the quality of the two types of instruction or changes 

in productive instructional time.   

In practice, many empirical studies identify the effects of ICT investment using policies 

that increase investment in technology at treated schools but not at control schools without 

10 Note that time not allocated to active teacher or computer instruction is modeled to have no academic 
benefit for the student. In practice, time spent receiving individualized computer instruction is substituting 
for whatever the students would have been doing during this time, which may have been independent 
learning. Thus the estimated effect of CAI in this model may be the benefit of CAI relative to independent 
learning.

an offsetting  reduction in traditional resources.  For  example, policies  exploited by  Angrist and 

Lavy (2002) and Leuven et al. (2007) create some schools that are winners and receive larger 

shares  of  national  ICT  investment.11  These  designs  seem  to  favor  finding  a  positive  effect 

relative  to  a  design  in  which  investment  must  satisfy  the  budget  constraint.  Specifically,  there 

does not need  to  be  an  offsetting reduction in traditional  resources. That  is, these designs may 

estimate  [A/C  +  A/TC*TC/C]    [A/TS*TS/S]  without  the  offsetting  effect  A/S. 

Further, there could be an income effect that increases investment in traditional resources (e.g. if 

funding normally used for computers is used to hire teachers aides). Thus a positive effect could 

be found even if the marginal dollar of investment in technology is not more effective than the 

marginal dollar invested in traditional resources, and (perhaps) even if technology has no benefit 

for educational production. Despite the fact that these designs favor finding positive effects, they 

could nonetheless produce negative estimates if time is reallocated to computer-based instruction 

and this has smaller returns than traditional instruction (e.g. if a high fraction of computer time is 

non-instructional).  It  is  also  possible  that  schools  may  reallocate  funds  away  from  traditional 

instruction to maintain or support investments in technology.  

An  analogous  discussion  is  relevant  for  interpreting  the  results  in  the  CAI  literature.  If 

CAI  substitutes  for  traditional  instruction,  then  the  estimated  effect  is  a  comparison  of  the 

marginal effects of traditional instruction and CAI (i.e. A/TC   A/TS). This is the economic 

and policy question of interest. However, many policies and experiments used to evaluate CAI 

increase a students instructional time in a specific subject (e.g. Rouse and Krueger 2004) or total 

instructional  time  (e.g.  Banerjee,  Cole,  Duflo,  and  Linden  2007).  This  occurs  when  non-

academic  classes  or  classes  dedicated  to  other  subjects  are  reallocated  to  the  subject  being 

11 Goolsbee and Guryan (2006) exploit the E-Rate subsidy that results in varying prices of computing 
across schools and thus has both a price and an income effect.

considered, or when instruction is offered outside of regular school hours. That is, the estimated 

effects in the literature frequently reflect an increase in T rather than just an increase in TC and 

the corresponding reduction in TS. Thus the results should be interpreted as some combination of 

the  effect  of  substituting  CAI  for  traditional  instruction  and  increasing  instructional  time.  It  is 

worth  noting  that  the  benefits  of  CAI,  like  those  of  ICT  more  broadly,  may  be  attenuated  if 

students use computers for non-academic purposes instead of the intended instruction. 

Therefore,  many  empirical  studies  on  ICT  and  CAI  are  structured  in  favor  of  finding 

positive effects on academic outcomes. Interpreting and comparing the estimates in the literature 

requires careful consideration of whether  computer resources  are supplementing or substituting 

for  traditional  investment.  Estimates  across  studies  are  also  likely  to  differ  due  to  variation  in 

treatment  intensity  (the  amount  of  financial  investment  or  the  number  of  hours  dedicated  to 

computer use), the duration of the treatment, the quality of the investment, and the quality of the 

traditional investment or instruction that is offset. 

2.3 Empirical Findings 

2.3.1 Information and Communication Technologies Investment 

Research  on  the  effects  of  ICT  investment  in  schools  has  closely  mirrored  the  broader 

literature on the effects of school investment (see, for example, Betts 1996; Hanushek, Rivkin, 

and Taylor 1996; and Hanushek 2006). Early studies of ICT in the education literature focused 

on  case  studies  and  cross-sectional  comparisons  (see  Kirkpatrick  and  Cuban  1998;  Noll,  et  al. 

2000  for  reviews).  Studies  in  the  economics  literature  have  often  exploited  natural  policy 

experiments  to  generate  variation  over  time  in  ICT  investment  (e.g.  Angrist  and  Lavy  2002; 

Goolsbee and Guryan 2006; Leuven 2007; Machin, McNally, and Silva 2007). Recent studies of 

13 

 
 
 
CAI have generally relied on randomized control trials (e.g. Rouse and Krueger 2004; Banerjee, 

Cole,  Duflo,  and  Linden  2007;  Mathematica  2009;  Carillo,  Onofa  and  Ponce  2010;  Mo  et  al. 

2014).  This  section  focuses  on  three  important  dimensions  of  variation  in  the  literature:  1)  the 

type of investment (ICT or CAI); 2) the research design (cross-sectional, natural experiment, or 

RCT);  and  3)  the  interaction  of  the  investment  with  traditional  instruction  (supplemental  or 

substituting). 

Fuchs and Woessmann (2004) examine international evidence on the correlation between 

computer  access  in  schools  (and  homes)  and  performance  on  PISA,  an  internationally 

administered  standardized  exam.  They  show  that  simple  cross-sectional  estimates  for  32 

countries  might  be  biased  due  to  the  strong  correlation  between  school  computers  and  other 

school  resources.  The  authors  note  that  evidence  based  on  cross-sectional  differences  must  be 

interpreted  cautiously.  Omitted  variables  are  likely  to  generate  positive  bias  in  cross-country 

comparisons.  However,  cross-sectional  estimates  within  countries  may  exhibit  negative  bias  if 

governments  target  resources  to  schools  that  serve  higher  proportions  of  students  from  low 

income  households.  Once  they  control  for  an  extensive  set  of  family  background  and  school 

characteristics,  they  find  an  insignificant  relationship  between  academic  achievement  and  the 

availability of school computers. 

Most recent research on ICT investment has exploited policies that promote investment in 

computer  hardware  or  Internet  access.  The  majority  of  studies  find  that  such  policies  result  in 

increased computer use in schools, but few studies find positive effects on educational outcomes. 

This is in spite of the fact that many of these studies exploit policies that provide ICT investment 

that supplements traditional investment. The results suggest that ICT does not generate gains in 

academic  outcomes  or  that  schools  allow  computer-based  instruction  to  crowd  out  traditional 

14 

 
instruction. Regardless, a null result in this context is a stronger result than if there was a binding 

constraint that required substitution away from investment and time allocated to other inputs. 

Angrist and Lavy (2002) find higher rates of computer availability in more disadvantaged 

schools in Israel, which may be due to the Israeli school system directing resources to schools on 

a remedial basis. Thus cross-sectional estimates of the effect of computer access are likely to be 

biased  downward.  To  address  this,  the  authors  exploit  a  national  program  that  provided 

computers and computer training for teachers in elementary and middle schools. The allocation 

of computers was based on which towns and regional authorities applied for the program, with 

the  highest  priority  given  to  towns  with  a  high  fraction  of  stand-alone  middle  schools.  They 

present reduced-form estimates of the effect of the program on student test scores and they use 

the  program  as  an  instrumental  variable  to  estimate  the  effect  of  computer  aided  instruction 

(defined  broadly)  on  test  scores.12  Survey  results  indicate  that  the  computers  were  used  for 

instruction, but the authors find negative and insignificant effects of the program on test scores. 

While  the  identification  strategy  estimates  the  effects  of  supplemental  financial  investment  in 

ICT,  it  did  not  necessarily  result  in  supplemental  class  time,  so  the  estimates  may  reflect  the 

tradeoff between computer aided and traditional instruction. The authors argue that computer use 

may have displaced other more productive educational activities or consumed school resources 

that might have prevented a decline in achievement. 

The  finding  that  ICT  investment  generates  limited  educational  gains  is  common  in  the 

literature.  Leuven  et  al.  (2007)  exploit  a  policy  in  the  Netherlands  that  provided  additional 

funding  for  computers  and  software  to  schools  with  more  than  seventy  percent  disadvantaged 

students. Using a regression discontinuity design, they find that while additional funding is not 

12 An identifying assumption for the instrumental variables interpretation is that CAI is the sole channel 
by which computers would positively or negatively affect academic performance. 

15 

 
                                                           
spent  on  more  or  newer  computers,  students  do  spend  more  time  on  a  computer  in  school 

(presumably due to new software). But the estimates suggest a negative and insignificant effect 

on most test score outcomes. The authors come to a similar to conclusion as Angrist and Lavy 

(2002) that computer instruction may be less effective than traditional instruction. 

In the United States, Goolsbee and Guryan (2006) examine the federal E-Rate subsidy for 

Internet  investment  in  California  schools.  The  subsidy  rate  was  tied  to  a  schools  fraction  of 

students  eligible  for  a  free  or  reduced  lunch,  which  generated  variation  in  the  rate  of  Internet 

investment, creating both an income and price effect.13 Schools that received larger subsidies had 

an  incentive  to  offset  spending  on  traditional  inputs  with  spending  on  Internet  access.  The 

authors find increased rates of Internet connectivity in schools, but do not find increases in test 

scores or other academic outcomes. The authors note that access to the Internet may not improve 

measurable student achievement and that promoting early adoption of technology may result in 

schools investing too soon in technologies and thus acquiring inferior or higher-cost products. In 

a  more  recent  paper,  Belo,  Ferreira,  and  Telang  (2014)  examine  if  broadband  use  generates  a 

distraction that reduces academic performance in Portugal. They find very large negative effects 

when  using  proximity  to  the  internet  provider  as  an  instrument  for  the  quality  of  the  internet 

connection and time spend using broadband. 

More recently, Cristia et al. (2014) examine the introduction of the Huascaran program in 

Peru between 2001 and 2006. The program provided hardware and non-educational software to a 

selected set of schools chosen on the basis of enrollment levels, physical access to the schools, 

and commitment to adopt computer use. Using various weighting and matching techniques, they 

find no effect of the program on whether students repeat a grade, drop out, or enroll in secondary 

13 The authors attempt to exploit discrete cutoffs in prices to implement a regression discontinuity design. 
Unfortunately, this does not result in a strong enough first stage to generate reliable estimates, so they 
exploit time variation in a difference-in-differences design. 

16 

 
                                                           
school  after  primary  school.  These  studies  highlight  the  importance  of  considering  the  policy 

estimates  in  the  context  of  an  educational  production  function  that  considers  classroom  inputs 

and  time  allocation.  Despite  ICT  funding  being  supplemental  to  traditional  investment, 

computers may reduce the use of traditional inputs given time constraints. 

There  are,  however,  exceptions  to  the  finding  that  ICT  investment  does  not  generate 

educational gains. Machin, McNally, and Silva (2007) exploit a change in how government ICT 

funds are allocated in England to generate variation in the timing of investment. This approach 

results in generally positive estimates for academic outcomes. The authors note that their results 

may be positive and significant in part because the schools that experienced the largest increases 

in  ICT  investment  were  already  effective  and  thus  may  have  used  the  investment  efficiently. 

Barrera-Osorio  and  Linden  (2009)  find  somewhat  inconclusive  results  with  statistically 

insignificant, but point estimates of effects, when they evaluate a randomized experiment at one 

hundred  public  schools  as  part  of  the  Computers  for  Education  program  in  Colombia.  The 

program  provided  schools  with  computers  and  teacher  training  with  an  emphasis  on  language 

education,  but  they  find  that  the  increase  in  computer  use  was  not  primarily  in  the  intended 

subject area, Spanish, but rather in computer science classes. Teacher and student surveys reveal 

that teachers did not incorporate the computers into their curriculum. 

A recent trend in educational technology policy is to ensure that every student has his or 

her  own  laptop  or  tablet  computer,  which  is  likely  to  be  a  much  more  intensive  treatment  (in 

terms of per-student time spent using a computer) than those exploited in the policies discussed 

above. One of the first large scale one-to-one laptop programs was conducted in Maine in 2002, 

in  which  all  7th  and  8th  grade  students  and  their  teachers  were  provided  with  laptops  to  use  in 

school. Comparing writing achievement before and after the introduction of laptops, it was found 

17 

 
that  writing  performance  improved  by  approximately  one-third  of  a  standard  deviation  (Maine 

Education Policy Research Institute 2007). Grimes and Warschauer (2008) and Suhr et al. (2010) 

examine  the  performance  of  students  at  schools  that  implemented  a  one  laptop  program  in 

Farrington  School  District  in  California  relative  to  students  at  non-laptop  schools.  They  find 

evidence that junior high school test scores declined in the first year of the program. Likewise, 

scores  in  reading  declined  for  4th  grade  students  during  the  first  year.  At  both  grade  levels, 

however, the scores increased in the second year, offsetting the initial decline. This pattern may 

reflect the fixed costs of adopting computer technology  effectively. The changes in these cases 

are relatively modest in magnitude, but are statistically significant.  

A  study  of  the  Texas  laptop  program  by  the  Texas  Center  for  Educational  Research 

(2009)  exploited  trends  at  twenty-one  schools  that  adopted  the  program  relative  to  a  matched 

control  group.  Schools  were  matched  on  factors  including  district  and  campus  size,  region, 

proportion of economically disadvantaged and minority students, and performance on the Texas 

Assessment  of  Knowledge  and  Skills  (TAKS).  The  laptop  program  was  found  to  have  some 

positive effects on educational outcomes. Cristia et al. (2012) were able to exploit a government 

implemented  randomized  control  trial  (RCT)  to  estimate  the  effect  of  a  laptop  policy  in  Peru. 

After  fifteen months, they  find no  significant  effect  on math  or language  test scores  and small 

positive effects on cognitive skills. 

Taken as a whole, the literature examining the effect of ICT investment is characterized 

by  findings of little  or no positive  effect  on most  academic outcomes.  The  exception  to this is 

mixed  positive  effects  of  one-laptop  initiatives.  The  modest  returns  to  computer  investment  is 

especially informative in light of the fact that nearly all of the estimates are based on policies and 

experiments  that  provided  supplemental  ICT  investment.  The  lack  of  positive  effects  is 

18 

 
consistent  across  studies  that  exploit  policy  variation  and  randomized  control  trials.  Because 

these initiatives do not necessarily increase class time, the findings may suggest that technology 

aided instruction is not superior to traditional instruction. This finding may be highly dependent 

on specifically  what technology is adopted and  how it is integrated into a schools curriculum. 

The studies above generally do not specify the way in which ICT was used. In the next section, 

we examine studies that focus on the use of specific, well-defined software programs to promote 

mathematics and language learning. 

2.3.2 Computer Assisted Instruction 

Computer aided instruction is the use of specific software programs on computers in the 

classroom.14  Frequently 

these  programs  are 

individualized  or  self-paced 

in  order 

to 

accommodate  differences  in  student  ability  or  speed.  CAI  lends  itself  to  evaluation  using 

randomized control trials because access to software can be offered at the student or classroom 

level. CAI frequently targets a specific subject area that is tested before and after the software is 

introduced.  Kulik  and  Kulik  (1991)  and  Liao  (1992)  summarize  the  early  education  literature, 

which  generally  suggests  positive  effects.  The  evidence  from  economic  studies  is  mixed  and 

suggests  that  the  characteristics  of  the  intervention  are  important.  Studies  in  this  area  differ 

significantly in the extent to which CAI is a substitute or a supplement to traditional instruction. 

Interestingly,  evidence  of  positive  effects  appears  to  be  the  strongest  in  developing  countries. 

14 Computer aided instruction (CAI), computer aided learning (CAL), and E-learning are used 
synonymously in the economics and education literatures. 

19 

 
 
                                                           
This  could  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  instruction  that  is  being  substituted  for  is  not  as  of  high 

quality in these countries.15 

Rouse  and  Kruegers  (2004)  evaluation  of  Fast  ForWord,  a  language  and  reading 

program,  is  one  of  the  earliest  examples  of  evaluating  a  specific  CAI  using  an  RCT.  They 

conducted  a  randomized  study  that  exploited  within-school,  within-grade  variation  at  four 

schools  that  serve  a  high  fraction  of  non-native  English  speakers  in  the  northeastern  United 

States. The intervention  pulled students out  of  their  otherwise  scheduled  classes to  receive 90-

100 minutes of individualized computer aided instruction. The instruction these students missed 

was  not  necessarily  in  reading  and  language,  so  treated  students  received  supplemental 

instruction  in  this  subject  area  as  a  result.  Despite  the  construction  of  the  experiment,  which 

favors gains in reading and language skills, they find little to no positive effects across a range of 

standardized tests that should be correlated with reading and language skills. The authors argue 

that computers may not be as effective as traditional classroom instruction. 

In a large randomized study, the U.S. Department of Education and Mathematica Policy 

Research  (2007,  2009)  evaluated  six  reading  and  four  math  software  products  for  students  in 

elementary,  middle,  and  high  school.  Randomization  was  across  teachers  within  the  same 

schools. Nine of the ten products were found to have no statistically significant effect, while the 

tenth  product  (used  for  4th  grade  reading)  had  a  positive  effect.  The  study  also  examined  how 

usage  and  effects  changed  between  the  first  and  the  second  years  of  implementation,  allowing 

the researchers to  test if teacher experience with the products was an important  determinant of 

outcomes.  They  found  that  usage  actually  decreased  on  average  in  the  second  year  and  there 

were no positive effects. 

15 There are well documented deficiencies in teacher quality and attendance and other education factors in 
developing countries. For example, Chaudhury et al. (2006) examine the rate of teacher absenteeism, 
which is 19 percent, and teacher effort in Bangladesh, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Peru and Uganda. 

20 

 
                                                           
Some  studies,  however,  find  positive  effects  of  CAI  initiatives.  Barrow,  Markman  and 

Rouse (2009) exploit a within-school randomization at the classroom level in three large urban 

districts  in  the  U.S.  They  find  statistically  significant  positive  effects  of  computer  aided 

instruction  when  treated  classes  are  taught  in  the  computer  lab  using  pre-algebra  and  algebra 

software.  They  also  find  some  evidence  that  the  effects  are  larger  for  classrooms  with  greater 

enrollment, which is consistent with the predictions of their model of time allocation (discussed 

in  Section  2.2).  The  authors  note  that  such  effects  may  not  translate  to  different  software  or 

different  schools,  but  conclude  that  the  positive  findings  suggest  that  CAI  deserves  additional 

evaluation  and  policy  attention  especially  because  it  is  relatively  easy  to  implement  compared 

with other interventions. 

Banerjee, Cole, Duflo, and Linden (2007) note that the generally insignificant effects of 

computer  interventions  in  developed  countries  may  not  hold  in  developing  countries  where 

computers may  replace  teachers with  less  motivation and  training.  They test an  intervention in 

India in which trained instructors guided students through two hours of computer instruction per 

week,  one  hour  of  which  was  outside  of  the  regular  school  day.  Thus  the  intervention  was  a 

combination  of  guided  computer  instruction  by  a  supplemental  instructor  and  additional  class 

time. They find that the intervention has large and statistically significant effects on math scores, 

but  also  find  significant  fade-out  in  subsequent  years.  However,  Linden  (2008)  finds  very 

different  results  when  attempting  to  separate  the  effects  of  in-class  substitution  for  standard 

instruction  from  out-of-school  complements.  Using  two  randomized  experiments,  test  score 

effects  for  2nd  and  3rd  graders  in  India  were  large  and  negative  for  the  in-school  intervention 

and insignificant and positive for the out-of-school intervention. The negative in-school results 

could  stem  from  the  fact  that  the  program  was  implemented  in  well-functioning  network  of 

21 

 
NGO-run  schools  or  that  the  specific  software  being  used  was  ineffective.  That  is,  both  the 

nature  of  the  technology  and  what  is  being  substituted  for  are  important  considerations  when 

evaluating effect sizes. 

Carrillo,  Onofa  and  Ponce  (2010)  find  positive  effects  of 

the  Personalized 

Complementary and Interconnected Learning software in Ecuador. The program was randomized 

at the school level and provided three hours of individualized math and language instruction to 

treated students each week. The initiative produced positive gains on math scores and no effect 

on  language  scores.  Mo  et  al.  (2014)  conduct  a  randomized  experiment  at  72  rural  schools  in 

China.  The  intervention  provided  80  minutes  of  supplemental  math  instruction  (math  based 

computer  games)  per  week  during  what  would  otherwise  be  a  computer  skills  class.  The 

intervention was estimated to generate an increase in math scores of 0.17 standard deviations for 

both 3rd and 5th grade students. It is important to note that the instruction was supplemental both 

in  terms  of  providing  additional  mathematics  instruction  and  not  offsetting  another  academic 

subject.16  

In an analysis of randomized interventions (both technological and non-technological) in 

developing countries, Kremer, Brannen, and Glennerster (2013) hypothesize that CAI tailored to 

each  student  may  be  the  most  effective.  McEwan  (2014)  concludes  that  computer  based 

interventions  in  primary  schools  have  higher  average  effects  (0.15  standard  deviations)  than 

teacher training, smaller classes, and performance incentives. However, he makes the important 

point that it is misleading to compare effect sizes without considering cost. 

2.3.3 Computer Skills 

16 The authors note that their results may differ from Linden (2008) due to the fact that by integrating the 
CAL program during a relatively unproductive period of timethe substitution effect may have been 
minimized. 

22 

 
 
                                                           
Computer  use  in  schools  may  benefit  students  in  two  ways:  through  the  acquisition  of 

computer skills that  are  useful  in  the labor market; and through the acquisition  of    basic skills 

such as math, reading, and writing. The economics literature has provided different justifications 

for focusing on the effectiveness of  computers  as  a pedagogical tool for  acquiring basic  skills. 

Angrist  and  Lavy  (2002)  argue  that  computer  skills  training  (CST)  seems  undeniably  useful 

whereas  the  evidence  for  CAI  is  both  limited  and  mixed.  Fuchs  and  Woessmann  (2004) 

provide  the  antithetical  justification  for  focusing  on  CAI,  arguing  that  the  literature  finds  little 

evidence that computer  skills have  direct returns on the labor market whereas the returns to 

basic academic skills are undeniable. There is clearly a need for more research on the effect of 

computer skills on labor market outcomes. 

Most of the studies discussed in this paper do not estimate the effect of ICT on computer 

skills. A primary challenge is that academic exams do not provide a direct measure of computer 

skills, so these benefits may go unmeasured. For example, Goolsbee and Guryan (2006) note that 

ICT may build skills that are unmeasured by standard tests. Several studies find evidence that 

enhance education in computer skills may be the primary result of many initiatives. For example, 

Barrera-Osorio  and  Linden  (2009)  find  a  significant  increase  in  computer  use  in  computer 

science  and  not  in  any  other  subject.  Likewise,  Bet,  Ibarrarn  and  Cristia  (2014)  find  that 

increased  availability  of  technology  affected  time  spent  teaching  digital  skills,  but  computers 

were not used in math and language. Recent one-to-one laptop program policies have highlighted 

the  need  for  21st  century  skills,  which  go  beyond  basic  computer  skills  and  are  likely  even 

more difficult to measure. 

2.3.4 Online College Courses 

23 

 
 
A new and rapidly growing area of research related to CAI is estimating the effectiveness 

of online instruction for college courses. In this context, online education is frequently a method 

for  delivering  traditional  instruction  (e.g.  streaming  videos  of  college  lectures).  The  primary 

question of interest is how student performance in online courses compares to performance in the 

equivalent traditional course. Evidence from the first wave of studies appears to show that, at this 

time,  Internet  courses  are  less  effective  than  in-person  instruction.  However,  because  online 

courses are lower cost per student, performance differences do not necessarily mean that online 

courses are not cost effective. Further, online courses may expand the number of students able to 

take courses due to financial, enrollment, or geographic constraints. 

Several recent studies exploit randomized assignment of students to online and in-person 

education  at  the  college  level.  Figlio  et  al.  (2013)  conduct  a  randomized  experiment  at  a  U.S. 

university  and  find  evidence  that  in-person  instruction  results  in  higher  performance  in 

introductory  microeconomics,  especially  for  males,  Hispanics,  and  lower-achieving  students. 

Alpert,  Couch  and  Harmon  (2015)  use  a  random  experiment  to  evaluate  instruction  in  an 

introductory economics course by traditional face-to-face classroom instruction, blended face-to-

face  and  online  instruction,  and  exclusive  online  instruction.  They  find  evidence  of  negative 

effects  on  learning  outcomes  from  online  instruction  relative  to  traditional  instruction,  but  no 

evidence of negative effects from blended instruction relative to traditional instruction. Bowen et 

al.  (2014)  conduct  an  experiment  at  six  college  campuses  to  compare  traditional  instruction  to 

hybrid  in-person  and  online  instruction  for  a  statistics  course.  They  find  no  significant 

performance  difference  in  performance  between  the  two  groups.  Bettinger  et  al.  (2014),  using 

variation  in  access  to  in-person  courses  as  an  instrument,  find  lower  performance  and  higher 

variation for students enrolled in online courses. Patterson (2014) proposes internet distractions 

24 

 
as  a  possible  reason  for  reduced  performance  in  online  courses.  He  conducts  an  experiment 

which  finds  that  student  performance  improves  when  they  use  a  commitment  device  to  limit 

access to certain webpages. In related work, Joyce et al. (2014) find experimental evidence that 

the  frequency  of  class  meetings  remains  important  even  when  course  materials  are  available 

online.

Header: Summary 
Several patterns emerge when evaluating the effects of computer use in schools. Divisions in the 

literature emerge in terms of the nature of the intervention being studied, the research design, the 

parameter being estimated, and the school context. We provide an overview of each study and its 

key  characteristics  and  findings  in  Table  4.  The  most  prominent  distinction  is  the  division 

between ICT and CAI focused studies, which tend to coincide with methodological differences. 

The  high  cost  of  ICT  hardware  and  connections,  and  the  fact  that  it  does  not  target  specific 

students  has  meant  that  the  majority  of  rigorous  empirical  research  has  exploited  natural 

experiments  generated  by  government  policies.  In  contrast,  several  studies  evaluating  CAI 

software,  which  can  target  specific  classrooms  or  students,  have  used  randomized  control  trial 

designs. It is important to note that despite the division between these two types of studies, ICT 

investment is likely to be a necessary condition for making CAI available.17 

Both  ICT  and  CAI  produce  somewhat  mixed  evidence  of  the  effect  of  computers  on 

student outcomes, though there appears to be more evidence of positive effects in studies of CAI. 

There  are  several  reasons  why  CAI  studies  may  be  more  likely  to  find  positive  effects.  One 

explanation  is  methodological.  Beyond  differences  in  research  design,  it  may  be  the  case  that 

17 This has a direct analogue in the economics of education literature more broadly. Many studies examine 
how funding affects student outcomes (with little regard for the specific inputs the funding makes 
possible) while other studies examine the effects of specific inputs. 

25 

 
 
                                                           
targeted CAI is more likely to generate positive effects than broader ICT initiatives. Specifically, 

CAI  studies  are  more  likely  to  result  in  supplemental  instructional  time.  That  is,  while  ICT 

studies  may  reflect  a  tradeoff  between  time  allocated  to  computer-based  instruction  and 

traditional instruction, CAI estimates may reflect the net increase in instruction and therefore be 

biased  in  favor  of  positive  findings.  Further,  ICT  investment  may  not  result  in  an  increase  in 

educational  software  and  may  increase  computer  use  that  detracts  from  traditional  instruction  

(e.g.  non-educational  computer  games,  social  networking,  or  internet  use).  By  contrast,  CAI 

studies focus narrowly on specific software and the educational outcomes that these are likely to 

affect. 

Some  of  the  notable  exceptions  to  the  pattern  of  null  effects  occur  in  studies  set  in  the 

context of developing, rather than developed countries. This may indicate that the quality of the 

education  or  other  activities  being  substituted  for  is  lower.  There  also  appears  to  be  some 

evidence  that  interventions  which  target  math  are  more  likely  to  generate  positive  effects  than 

interventions  that  target  language.  This  could  be  due  to  the  relative  ease  of  making  effective 

software for math relative to language or the relative ease of generating gains in math. 

The  finding  that  the  results  do  not  adhere  to  clear  patterns  should  not  be  surprising. 

Policies and experiments differ in cost, the type of treatment (the specific hardware or software 

provided), the length of the intervention (number of years), the intensity of the treatment (hours 

per day), whether they supplement or substitute for other inputs, the grade levels treated, and the 

academic  subject  targeted.  We  highlight  these  differences  in  Table  4.  Also,  relatively  little 

attention is given in the literature to heterogeneity in treatment effects by student characteristics, 

which is likely due in part to the finding of no effect overall in many studies. Nonetheless, some 

studies do differentiate  the  effects by  gender and by baseline academic performance. While no 

26 

 
patterns  by  gender  emerge,  some  studies  find  evidence  that  computer  resources  benefit  lower 

performing students more than the highest performing students (e.g. Banerjee, Cole, Duflo, and 

Linden 2007 and Barrow, Markman, and Rouse 2009). 

3. Technology Use at Home by Students 

3.1 Estimates of rates of technology use at home by students 

Computer  and  Internet  use  at  home  has  grown  rapidly  over  the  past  two  decades.  It  is 

astonishing  that  only  20  years  ago  less  than  one-fourth  of  the  U.S.  population  had  access  to  a 

computer at home (see Figure 2). Only 17 years ago, less than one-fifth of the U.S. population 

had an Internet connection at home. The most recent data available for the United States, which 

are for 2012, indicate that roughly 80 percent of the population has access to a home computer 

and 75 percent of the population has access to an Internet connection at home. 

Schoolchildren have even higher rates of access  to computers and the  Internet at home. 

Eighty-six percent  have  access to computers  and  83  percent  have access  to  the  Internet. These 

rates are considerably higher than when the CPS first collected information on home computer 

access. In 1984, roughly 15 percent of children had access to a computer at home (U.S. Census 

Bureau 1988) Access to home computers and the Internet also rises with the age of the student 

(see Figure 3). Home Internet use rises especially sharply with the age of the student. 

Surveys  from  the  2012  Programme  for  International  Student  Assessment  (PISA) 

conducted  by  the  OECD  provide  information  on computer  and  Internet  access  at  home  among 

schoolchildren  across  a  large  number  of  countries.  Table  2  reports  estimates  for  the  50  largest 

countries in the world with available data. In most developed countries a very large percentage of 

schoolchildren have access to a computer at home that they can use for schoolwork. In contrast, 

27 

 
 
schoolchildren in developing countries often have very low levels of access. For example, only 

26  percent  of  schoolchildren  in  Indonesia  and  40  percent  of  schoolchildren  in  Vietnam  have 

access to a home computer. In most developed countries a very large percent of schoolchildren 

also report having an Internet connection. Although data availability is more limited for Internet 

connection  rates,  the  PISA  data  provide  some  evidence  that  children  in  developing  countries 

have  lower  levels  of  access  than  developed  countries.  Only  52  percent  of  schoolchildren  in 

Mexico, for example, report having an Internet connection at home. These patterns of access to 

home  computers  and  Internet  among  schoolchildren  generally  follow  those  for  broader 

household-based measures of access to home computers and the Internet published by the OECD 

(2104) and International Telecommunications Union (2014a).18 ITU data indicate that 78 percent 

of  households  in  developed  countries  have  Internet  access  compared  with  31  percent  of 

households in developing countries (ITU 2014b). 

Over  the  past  decade  the  percentage  of  students  with  home  computers  has  increased. 

Figure 4 displays trends in home computer access from 2003 to 2012 for selected large countries 

with available data. Home computer rates for schoolchildren have been very high in high-income 

countries  such  as  the  United  States  and  Germany  over  the  past  decade.  Other  large  countries 

have experienced rapid improvements in access to computers among schoolchildren over the past 

decade.  Russia  has  caught  up  with  high-income  countries,  and  access  to  computers  in  Brazil 

grew from 36 percent as recently as 2006 to 72 percent in 2012. Schoolchildren in Mexico and 

Turkey have also seen  rapid improvements in  access  to home  computers over the past  decade. 

Access  to  home  computers  has  grown  over  the  past  decade  for  Indonesian  schoolchildren,  but 

remains relatively low. 

18 See Caselli and Coleman (2001); Wallsten (2005); Dewan, Ganley and Kraemer (2010); Andrs et al. 
(2010); Chinn and Fairlie (2007, 2010) for a few examples of previous studies of disparities in computer 
and Internet penetration across countries. 

28 

 
                                                           
Even  with  very  high  rates  of  access  to  home  computers  and  the  Internet  in  developed 

countries, large disparities remain within countries.19 In the United States, for example, 9 million 

schoolchildren  do  not  have  access  to  the  Internet  at  home  with  the  lack  of  access  being 

disproportionately 

concentrated 

among 

low-income 

and 

disadvantaged  minority 

schoolchildren.20 Among schoolchildren living in households with $25,000 or less of income 67 

percent  have  access  to  a  home  computer  and  59  percent  have  access  to  the  Internet  at  home, 

whereas  98  percent  of  schoolchildren  living  in  households  with  $100,000  or  more  in  income 

have  access  to  a  home  computer  and  97  percent  have  access  to  the  Internet  at  home.  Large 

disparities  also  exist  across  race  and  ethnicity.  Among  African-American  schoolchildren  78 

percent  have  home  computers  and  73  percent  have  home  Internet  access,  and  among  Latino 

schoolchildren  78  percent  have  home  computers  and  71  percent  have  home  Internet  access.  In 

contrast,  92  percent  of  white,  non-Latino  schoolchildren  have  home  computers  and  89  percent 

have home Internet access. 

Disparities  in  access  to  home  computers  within  countries  and  across  countries  may 

contribute to  educational inequality. However, the rapidly  expanding  use  of computers and the 

Internet  at  home  in  developing  countries  might  have  implications  for  relative  trends  in 

educational outcomes. 

3.2 Theoretical Issues 

In addition to teacher and school inputs, student and family inputs are important for the 

educational production function. The personal computer is an example of one of these inputs in 

19 See Hoffman and Novak 1998; Mossberger, Tolbert, and Stansbury 2003; Warschauer (2003); Ono and 
Zavodny 2007; Fairlie 2004; Mossberger, Tolbert, and Gilbert 2006; Goldfarb and Prince 2008 for 
examples of previous studies of disparities in computer and Internet use within countries. 
20 These estimates are calculated from October 2012 Current Population Survey, Internet Use Supplement 
microdata. 

29 

 
 
                                                           
the educational production process, and there are several reasons to suspect that it is important. 

First, personal computers make it easier to complete course assignments through the use of word 

processors,  the  Internet,  spreadsheets,  and  other  software  (Lenhart,  et  al.  2001,  Lenhart,  et  al. 

2008).  Although  many  students  could  use  computers  at  school  and  libraries,  home  access 

represents  the  highest  quality  access  in  terms  of  availability,  flexibility  and  autonomy,  which 

may  provide  the  most  benefits  to  the  user  (DiMaggio  and  Hargittai  2001).  Children  report 

spending  an  average  of  16  minutes  per  day  using  computers  for  schoolwork  (Kaiser  Family 

Foundation  2010).  Access  to  a  home  computer  may  also  improve  familiarity  with  software 

increasing the effectiveness of computer use for completing school assignments and the returns 

to computer use at school (Underwood, et al. 1994, Mitchell Institute 2004, and Warschauer and 

Matuchniak 2009). As with computers used in school, owning a personal computer may improve 

computer  specific  skills  that  increase  wages  in  some  fields.  Finally,  the  social  distractions  of 

using a computer in a crowded computer lab may be avoided by using a computer at home. 

On  the  other  hand,  home  computers  are  often  used  for  games,  social  networking, 

downloading music and  videos,  communicating  with  friends,  and  other  forms of  entertainment 

potentially  displacing  time  for  schoolwork  (Jones  2002;  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  2004; 

Kaiser Family Foundation 2010).21 Children report spending an average of 17 minutes per day 

using computers for  playing  games  and  an  average of 21  minutes per  day using computers for 

watching videos and other entertainment (Kaiser Family Foundation 2010). A large percentage 

of computer users report playing games at least a few times a week (Lenhart, Jones and Rankin 

2008).  Time  spent  using  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook  and  Myspace  and  other 

entertainment  sites  such  as  YouTube  and  iTunes  has  grown  rapidly  over  time  (Lenhart  2009). 

21 Similar concerns were expressed earlier over television crowding out schoolwork time (see Zavodny 
2006 for example). 

30 

 
 
                                                           
Children  report  spending  an  average  of  22  minutes  per  day  using  computers  for  social 

networking (Kaiser Family Foundation 2010). Computers are often criticized for displacing more 

active  and  effective  forms  of  learning  and  for  emphasizing  presentation  (e.g.  graphics)  over 

content  (Giacquinta,  et  al.  1993,  Stoll  1995  and Fuchs  and  Woessmann  2004).  Computers  and 

the  Internet also  facilitate cheating and plagiarism and  make  it easier  to  find  information from 

non-credible  sources  (Rainie  and  Hitlin  2005).  In  the  end,  it  is  ambiguous  as  to  whether  the 

educational benefits of home computers outweigh their distraction and displacement costs. 

Beltran,  Das  and  Fairlie  (2010)  present  a  simple  theoretical  model  that  illustrates  these 

points  in  the  context  of  a  utility  maximization  problem  for  a  high  school  student.  A  linear 

random utility model of the decision to graduate from high school is used. Define Ui0 and Ui1 as 

the ith person's indirect utilities associated with not graduating and graduating from high school, 

respectively. These indirect utilities can be expressed as: 

(3.1) Ui0 = 0 + 0'Xi + 0Ci + 0t(Wi, Ci) + Y0(Zi, Ci) + i0, and 

(3.2) Ui1 = 1 + 1'Xi + 1Ci + 1t(Wi, Ci) + Y1(Zi, Ci) + i1, 

where  Xi,  Zi  and  Wi  may  include  individual,  parental,  family,  geographical,  and  school 

characteristics; Ci is the  presence of a home computer; Y0 and Y1 are expected  future earnings; 

and t is the child's achievement (e.g. test score), and i is an additive error term. Xi, Zi and Wi do 

not  necessarily  include  the  same  characteristics  because  the  individual,  family  and  other 

characteristics affecting utility, test scores and expected future earnings  may or may not differ. 

Achievement is determined by the characteristics, Wi, and the presence of computers is allowed 

to have different effects on the utility from the two educational choices. Expected earnings differ 

31 

 
 
 
 
between graduating from high school and not graduating from high school, and are functions of 

the characteristics, Zi, and home computers. 

In  the  model,  there  are  three  major  ways  in  which  home  computers  affect  educational 

outcomes. First, there is a direct  effect of having a home computer on the utility of graduating 

from  high  school,  1.  Personal  computers  make  it  easier  to  complete  homework  assignments 

through  the  use  of  word  processors,  spreadsheets,  Internet  browsers  and  other  software,  thus 

increasing  the  utility  from  completing  schoolwork.  Home  access  to  computers  offers  more 

availability  and  autonomy  than  school  access  and  may  familiarize  students  with  computers 

increasing the returns to computer use in the classroom. Second, access to home computers may 

have  an  additional  effect  on  the  utility  of  staying  in  school  beyond  making  it  easier  to  finish 

homework and complete assignments. In particular, the use of home computers may "open doors 

to learning"  and  doing  well in school (Cuban 2001  and  Peck,  et al.  2002),  and  thus  encourage 

some  teenagers  to  graduate  from  school.  Third,  personal  computers  also  provide  utility  from 

games,  email,  chat  rooms,  downloading  music,  and  other  non-education  uses  creating  an 

opportunity cost from doing homework. The higher opportunity cost increases the utility of not 

graduating from high school. On the other  hand,  the  use  of computers  at  home, even for these 

non-educational uses, keeps children off the street, potentially reducing delinquency and criminal 

activities.  These  activities  increase  the  utility  from  dropping  out  of  school.  The  two  opposing 

factors make it difficult to sign the effect of computers on the utility from not graduating from 

high school, 0. 

Another way in which personal computers affect the high school  graduation decision is 

through their effects on academic achievement. Computers could improve academic performance 

directly  through  the  use  of  educational  software  and  focusing  time  use  on  content.  Computers 

32 

 
and  the  Internet,  however,  may  displace  other  more  active  forms  of  learning,  emphasize 

presentation  over  content,  and  increase  plagiarism.  Therefore,  the  theoretical  effects  of 

computers  on  academic  achievement,  dt/dC,  and  thus  on  the  utility  from  graduating  from  high 

school, 1dt/dC, is ambiguous. Finally, computer skills may improve employment opportunities 

and  wages,  but  mainly  in  combination  with  a  minimal  educational  credential  such  as  a  high 

school diploma, implying that dY1/dC > dY0/dC. 

Focusing on the high school graduation decision, we assume that the individual graduates 

from high school if Ui1 > Ui0. The probability of graduating from high school, yi=1, is: 

(3.3) P(yi=1) = P(Ui1 > Ui0)= 

F[(1-0) + (1-0)'Xi +(1 - 0)Ci + (Y1(Zi, Ci) - Y0(Zi, Ci)) + (1 - 0)t(Wi, Ci)] 

where  F  is  the  cumulative  distribution  function  of  i1-i0.  In  (3.3),  the  separate  effects  of 

computers  on  the  probability  of  graduating  from  high  school  are  expressed  in  relative  terms. 

Home computers have a direct effect on the graduation probability through relative utility, and 

indirect effects through improving achievement and altering relative earnings. The net effect of 

home computers on high school graduation, however, is theoretically ambiguous. 

Vigdor, Ladd and Martinez (2014) model the adolescent's maximization problem as one 

of  allocating  time  and  money  across  competing  uses.  Adolescents  devote  time  ti  and  pay  a 

monetary  cost  pi  to  engage  in  different  activities  within  the  set  of  all  potential  activities.  Each 

activity  contributes  directly  to  the  adolescent's  utility,  and  some  activities  also  contribute 

indirectly to utility through building human capital and increasing future living standards. Utility 

can be written as U = U(A, S(A)), where A is the vector of activity choices and S(A) is the future 

33 

 
 
 
living  standard  given  these  activity  choices.  Not  all  activities  increase  future  living  standards, 

and adolescents place at least some weight on future living standards in the their computation of 

utility.  Adolescents  also  face  a  time  constraint  and  a  budget  constraint.  The  solution  to  the 

resulting utility maximization problem equates the ratio of prices of any two activities to the ratio 

of marginal utilities of the two activities. 

Using this framework, the introduction of home computers and broadband Internet can be 

viewed as a shock to the prices and time costs of various activities. Vigdor, Ladd and Martinez 

(2014) provide several examples in which computer technology reduces the prices and time costs 

of activities, and  thus  potentially increases their  use.  They note that access to word processing 

software reduces the cost of revising a term paper, and access to broadband reduces the cost of 

conducting research for an essay. Computer and broadband access also reduce the marginal cost 

of playing games or engaging in multiparty conversations with friends. The first two examples of 

activities  presumably  have  a  positive  impact  on  expected  future  living  standards,  whereas  the 

impact on expected future living standards of games and social networking is less clear. Even if 

these  two  activities  have  positive  returns,  they  might  have  smaller  returns  to  future  living 

standards than the activities that they displace. 

Vigdor, Ladd, and Martinez (2014) also note that the simple model could be expanded to 

incorporate  the  cost  of  technology.  Although  the  adolescent  is  unlikely  to  purchase  computers 

with  his/her  own  money,  the  family's  purchase  of  computers  and  Internet  service  could  crowd 

out  other  "educational"  expenditures.  Another  issue  is  that  the  maximization  problem  requires 

adolescents to make decisions with long-run consequences, and they may not be "neurologically" 

developed  enough  to  make  such  decisions.  This  is  less  of  a  problem,  however,  if  adolescents 

have at least weak preferences for building human capital and improving future living standards. 

34 

 
Another  point  that  Vigdor,  Ladd  and  Martinez  raise  is  that  in  many  cases  the  realized  time 

allocations  of  adolescents  will  be  determined  not  only  by  their  own  preferences,  but  by 

constraints placed on them by parents, teachers and other adults. The model could be revised to 

incorporate  these  restrictions  on  activities,  but  one  important  implication  is  that  the  impact  of 

computer technology on educational outcomes could vary with parental supervision. 

These  theoretical  models  provide  some  insights  into  how  home  computers  might  exert 

both positive and negative influences on educational outcomes, and demonstrate that the net total 

effect  is  difficult  to  determine.  Families  and  students  are  likely  to  make  decisions  about 

computer purchases and Internet subscriptions in part based on these comparisons. If households 

are rational and face no other frictions, those households without computers have decided not to 

buy a computer because the returns are relatively low. However, it is also possible that various 

constraints  prevent  households  from  investing  in  home  computers  even  if  the  returns  are  high. 

Parents may face credit constraints, be unaware of the returns to computer use, not be technically 

comfortable  with  computers,  and  have  concerns  about  privacy.  There  is  reason  to  suspect  that 

these  constraints  might  be  important,  given  that  households  without  computers  tend  to  be 

substantially poorer and  less educated than other households. Thus, the effect of computers for 

such families is an open and important question. 

3.3 Empirical Findings 

3.3.1 Effects of home computers and the Internet on educational outcomes 

Although the theoretical models provide some insights into how home computers might 

exert positive and negative effects on the educational outcomes, they do not provide a prediction 

of the sign and magnitude of the net effect. A small, but growing empirical literature estimates 

the net effects of home computers on a wide range of educational outcomes. The literature on the 

35 

 
 
topic  has  evolved  over  time  primarily  through  methodological  improvements.  Earlier  studies 

generally  regress  educational  outcomes  on  the  presence  of  a  home  computer  while  controlling 

for student, family and parental characteristics. More recent studies focus on quasi-experimental 

approaches and randomized control experiments. 

One  of  the  first  studies  to  explore  whether  home  computers  have  positive  educational 

effects  on  children  was  Attewell  and  Battle  (1999).  Using  the  1988  National  Educational 

Longitudinal  Survey  (NELS),  they  provide  evidence  that  test  scores  and  grades  are  positively 

related to access to home computers among eighth graders even after controlling for differences 

in  several  demographic  and  individual  characteristics  including  typically  unobservable 

characteristics of the educational environment in the household.22 

Using data from the 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS), Fairlie (2005) estimates the 

relationship  between  school  enrollment  and  having  a  home  computer  among  teenagers. 

Controlling  for  family  income,  parental  education,  parental  occupation  and  other  observable 

characteristics in probit regressions for the probability of school enrollment, he finds a difference 

of 1.4 percentage points (base rate of 85 percent). In a subsequent paper, Beltran, Das and Fairlie 

(2010) use panel data from the matched CPS (2000-2004) and the National Longitudinal Survey 

of  Youth  (1997-  2002)  to  estimate  the  relationship  between  home  computers  and  subsequent 

high  school  graduation.  They  find  that  teenagers  who  have  access  to  home  computers  are  68 

percentage  points  more  likely  to  graduate  from  high  school  than  teenagers  who  do  not  after 

controlling  for  individual,  parental,  and  family  characteristics.  Using  detailed  data  available  in 

the NLSY97, they also find that the estimates are not sensitive to the inclusion of difficult-to-find 

22 They include measures of the frequency of child-parent discussions of school-related matters, parents 
familiarity with the parents of their child's friends, attendance in "cultural" classes outside of school, 
whether the child visits science or history museums with the parent, and an index of the educational 
atmosphere of the home (e.g. presence of books, encyclopedias, newspapers, and place to study). 

36 

 
                                                           
characteristics of the educational environment in the household and extracurricular activities of 

the  student.23  Estimates  indicate  a  strong  positive  relationship  between  home  computers  and 

grades,  a  strong  negative  relationship  with  school  suspension,  and  suggestive  evidence  of  a 

negative relationship with criminal activities. 

Schmitt and Wadsworth (2006), using the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2001), 

find a significant positive association between home computers and performance on the British 

school  examinations.  The  results  are  robust  to  the  inclusion  of  individual,  household  and 

geographical controls, including proxies for household wealth and prior educational attainment. 

Fiorini  (2010)  provides  evidence  on  the  impacts  of  home  computers  among  young  Australian 

children ages 4 to 7. She shifts the focus from access to home computers to computer use among 

children  (although  some  results  include  computer  access  as  an  instrumental  variable  for 

computer  use).  Using  data  from  the  Longitudinal  Study  of  Australian  Children  (2004-06),  she 

finds evidence of a positive relationship between computer use and cognitive skills among young 

children. 

In  contrast  to  these  findings  of  positive  effects  of  home  computers  on  educational 

outcomes, Fuchs and Woessmann (2004) find a negative relationship between home computers 

and student achievement using data from 31 developed and emerging countries among teenagers. 

Using the PISA database, they find that students with home computers have significantly lower 

math and reading test scores after controlling for student, family and school characteristics and 

country  fixed  effects.  They  find  a  large  positive  association  between  home  computers  and  test 

scores in bivariate comparisons without controls. 

23 The controls include religion, private school attendance, whether a language other than English is 
spoken at home, whether there is a quiet place to study at home, and whether the child takes extra classes 
or lessons, such as music, dance, or foreign language lessons. 

37 

 
 
                                                           
Although regressions of educational outcomes on home computers frequently control for 

numerous  individual,  family  and  school  characteristics,  they  may  nonetheless  produce  biased 

estimates  of  causal  effects  due  to  omitted  variables.  In  particular,  if  the  most  educationally 

motivated  families  (after  controlling  for  child  and  family  characteristics)  are  more  likely  to 

purchase  computers,  then  a  positive  relationship  between  academic  performance  and  home 

computers  may  capture  the  effect  of  unmeasurable  motivation  on  academic  performance. 

Conversely, if the least educationally motivated families are more likely to purchase computers, 

perhaps motivated by their entertainment value, then estimates will be downward biased. 

To  address  these  concerns,  a  few  recent  studies  (including  some  discussed  above) 

estimate  the  impacts  of  home  computers  on  educational  outcomes  using  instrumental  variable 

techniques,  individual-student  fixed  effects,  and  falsification  tests.  Fairlie  (2005)  addresses  the 

endogeneity  issue  by  estimating  instrumental  variable  models.  Bivariate  probit  models  of  the 

joint  probability  of  school  enrollment  and  owning  a  home  computer  result  in  large  positive 

coefficient  estimates  (7.7  percentage  points).  Use  of  computers  and  the  Internet  by  the  child's 

mother  and  father,  and  MSA-level  home  computer  and  Internet  rates  are  used  as  exclusion 

restrictions.  Some  supporting  evidence  is  provided  that  these  variables  should  affect  the 

probability  of  the  family  purchasing  a  home  computer  but  should  not  affect  academic 

performance  after  controlling  for  family  income,  parental  education  and  occupation,  and  other 

factors. Beltran, Das and Fairlie (2010) also estimate bivariate probits for the joint probability of 

high school  graduation  and owning a  home computer and find point  estimates similar to those 

from  a  multivariate  regression.  Similar  exclusion  restrictions  are  used  with  the  addition  of  the 

presence  of  another  teenager  in  the  household.  Fiorini  (2010)  uses  instrumental  variables  for 

computer  use  in  her  study  of  young  Australian  children  and  generally  finds  larger  positive 

38 

 
estimates of computer use on test scores than in OLS regressions. The number of older siblings 

and  Internet  use  at  work  by  men  and  women  at  the  postcode  level  are  used  as  exclusion 

restrictions. 

Another  approach,  first  taken  by  Schmidt  and  Wadsworth  (2006),  is  to  include  future 

computer  ownership  in  the  educational  outcome  regression.  A  positive  estimate  of  future 

computer  ownership  on  educational  attainment  would  raise  concerns  that  current  ownership 

proxies  for  an  unobserved  factor,  such  as  educational  motivation.  Future  computer  ownership, 

however,  is  not  found  to  have  a  positive  relationship  with  educational  outcomes  similar  to  the 

positive relationship found for contemporaneous computer ownership (Schmidt and Wadsworth 

2006 and Beltran, Das and Fairlie 2010). Along these lines of falsification tests or "pencil tests" 

(DiNardo  and  Pischke  1997),  Schmidt  and  Wadsworth  (2006)  do  not  find  evidence  that  other 

household  assets  which  proxy  for  wealth  such  as  dishwashers,  driers  and  cars  have  similar 

effects on educational attainment. Similarly, Beltran, Das and Fairlie (2008) do not find evidence 

of  a  positive  relationship  between  educational  attainment  and  having  a  dictionary  or  cable 

television  at  home,  which  also  might  be  correlated  with  unobserved  educational  motivation  or 

wealth. 

A  couple  of  studies  address  selection  concerns  by  estimating  fixed  effect  models.  The 

inclusion of student fixed effects controls for differences in unobservable characteristics that are 

time-invariant. Vigdor, Ladd and Martinez (2014), using panel data from North Carolina public 

schools, find modestly-sized negative effects of home computer access and local-area access to 

high-speed Internet connections on math and reading test scores when including fixed effects. In 

contrast, they find positive estimates when student fixed effects are excluded. Beltran, Das and 

39 

 
Fairlie (2010) find that adding student fixed effects results in smaller positive point estimates that 

lose significance. 

Malamud  and  Pop-Eleches  (2010)  address  the  endogeneity  problem  with  a  regression 

discontinuity  design  (RDD)  based  on  the  effects  of  a  government  program  in  Romania  that 

allocated  a  fixed  number  of  vouchers  for  computers  to  low-income  children  in  public  schools. 

The basic idea of the RDD is that schoolchildren just below the income threshold for eligibility 

for a computer voucher are compared to schoolchildren just above the income threshold. The two 

groups  of  schoolchildren  close  to  the  threshold  have  nearly  identical  characteristics  and  differ 

only in their eligibility for the computer voucher. Estimates from the discontinuity indicate that 

Romanian  children  winning  vouchers  have  lower  grades,  but  higher  cognitive  ability  as 

measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices. 

A  few  randomized  control  experiments  have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effects  of 

home computers on educational outcomes. The first random experiment involving the provision 

of  free  computers  to  students  for  home  use  was  Fairlie  and  London  (2012).  The  random-

assignment  evaluation  was  conducted  with  286  entering  students  receiving  financial  aid  at  a 

large  community  college  in  Northern  California.24  Half  of  the  participating  students  were 

randomly  selected  to  receive  free  computers.  After  two  years,  the  treatment  group  of  students 

who received  free  computers had modestly better  educational outcomes  than the  control  group 

along a few measures. Estimates for a summary index of educational outcomes indicate that the 

treatment group is 0.14 standard deviations higher than the control group mean. Students living 

farther  from  campus  and  students  who  have  jobs  appear  to  have  benefitted  more  from  the 

24 The focus on the impacts of computers on community college students is important, unlike four-year 
colleges where many students live on campus and have access to large computer labs, community college 
students often have limited access to on-campus technology.

flexibility  afforded by  home computers. The results from the  experiment also provide the only 

evidence in the literature on the effects of home computers for post-secondary students. 

Fairlie and Robinson (2013) also conduct a random experiment, but shift the focus from 

college  students  to  schoolchildren.  The  experiment  includes  1,123  students  in  grades  6-10 

attending  15  schools  across  California.  All  of  the  schoolchildren  participating  in  the  study  did 

not  have  computers  prior  to  the  experiment  and  half  were  randomly  selected  to  receive  free 

computers. The results indicate that even though there was a large effect on computer ownership 

and  total  hours  of  computer  use,  there  is  no  evidence  of  an  effect  on  a  host  of  educational 

outcomes, including grades, standardized test scores, credits earned, attendance, and disciplinary 

actions. No test score effects are found at the mean, at important cutoffs in the distribution (e.g. 

passing and proficiency), or at quantiles in the distribution. The estimates are precise enough to 

rule  out  even  moderately-sized  positive  or  negative  effects.  Consistent  with  these  results,  they 

find no evidence that treatment students spent more time on homework and that the computers 

had  an  effect  on  turning  homework  in  on  time,  software  use,  computer  knowledge,  or  other 

intermediate inputs in education. Treatment students report spending more time on computers for 

schoolwork,  but  they  also  report  spending  more  time  on  computers  playing  games,  social 

networking and for other entertainment. 

Most  of  the  evidence  in  the  literature  focuses  on  the  effects  of  home  computers  on  the 

educational  outcomes  of  schoolchildren  in  developed  or  transition  economies.  A  couple  of 

previous studies use random experiments to examine the impacts of one laptop per child (OLPC) 

laptops on educational outcomes in developing countries.25 Beuermann et al. (2012) examine the 

25 Although the One Laptop per Child program in Peru (Cristia et al. 2012) and the Texas laptop program 
(evaluated with a quasi-experiment in Texas Center for Educational Research 2009) were initially 
intended to allow students to take computers home when needed in addition to using them in school, this 
did not happen in most cases. In Peru, some principals, and even parents, did not allow the computers to

impacts of  randomly  providing  approximately 1,000  laptops for  home  use  to schoolchildren  in 

grades  1  through  6  in  Peru.26  They  find  that  the  laptops  have  a  positive,  but  small  and 

insignificant  effect  on  cognitive  skills  as  measured  by  the  Raven's  Progressive  Matrices  test 

(though  the  effect  is  significant  among  children  who  did  not  already  have  a  home  computer 

before  the  experiment).  Teachers  reported  that  the  effort  exerted  in  school  was  significantly 

lower  for  treatment  students  than  control  students  and  that  treated  children  reported  reading 

books,  stories  or  magazines  less  than  control  children.  Mo  et  al.  (2012)  randomly  distribute 

OLPC  laptops  to  roughly  half  of  a  sample  of  300  young  schoolchildren  (grade  3)  in  China.27 

They find some evidence that the laptops improved math test scores, but no evidence of effects 

on Chinese tests. They also find that the laptops increased learning activity use of computers and 

decreased time spent watching television. 

3.3.2 Heterogeneity in Home Computer Effects 

The effects of home computers on educational outcomes might differ across subgroups of 

the student population. For example, minority students might benefit more or less from having a 

home  computer  because  of  more  limited  opportunities  for  alternative  places  of  access,  social 

interactions with other computer users, and learning about use from parents, siblings and friends. 

Girls  and  boys  may  differ  in  how  they  use  computers  possibly  resulting  in  differential  effects. 

Several studies estimate separate home computer effects by demographic group and other student 

come home because of concerns that the laptops would not be replaced through the program if they were 
damaged or stolen. The result is that only 40 percent of students took the laptops home, and home use was 
substantially lower than in-school use. In Texas, there were similar concerns resulting in many schools 
not allowing computers to be taken home or restricting their home use. The main effect from these laptop 
programs is therefore to provide one computer for every student in the classroom, rather than to increase 
home access. 
26 Recipients of the laptops were also provided with an instruction manual and seven weekly training 
sessions. 
27 The laptops included some tutoring software and one training session was provided.

characteristics. For example, in Attewell and Battle's (1999) study of home computer effects on 

the test scores and grades of eighth graders they find evidence of stronger positive relationships 

between home computers and educational outcomes for higher SES children, boys, and whites. 

Fiorini's (2010) study of the impacts of home computer use on cognitive and non-cognitive skills 

among Australian children ages 4 to 7 finds evidence of larger effects for girls and children with 

less  educated  parents.  Fairlie  (2012)  finds  larger  effects  of  home  computers  on  educational 

outcomes for minority college students than non-minority college students. 

As  with  school-based  interventions,  the  evidence  is  mixed  with  several  studies  not 

finding evidence of heterogeneity in the effects of home computers. For example, Beltran, Das 

and  Fairlie  (2010)  estimate  regressions  that  include  interactions  between  home  computers  and 

race,  income  or  gender  and,  in  almost  all  cases,  do  not  find  statistically  significant  interaction 

effects.  Fairlie  and  Robinson  (2013)  and  Fairlie  (2015)  find  no  evidence  of  heterogeneous 

treatment  effects  by  pre-treatment  academic  achievement,  parental  supervision,  propensity  for 

non-game  use,  grade,  race,  or  gender.  Beuermann  et  al.  (2012)  find  some  evidence  of  a  larger 

reduction in school effort for younger Peruvian children, but essentially no difference in effects 

on  cognitive  skills  for  younger  children  and  no  difference  in  effects  on  school  effort  and 

cognitive  skills  by  gender.  In  their  study  of  Romanian  schoolchildren,  Malumud  and  Pop-

Eleches (2010) do  not  find evidence of differential effects  by  gender, but do find that  younger 

children  experience  larger  gains  in  cognitive  skills.  Given  the  lack  of  consistency  in  findings 

across studies for any subgroup, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions on this question. 

3.3.3 Effects on Computer Skills and Other Outcomes 

43 

 
 
Several  previous  studies  examine  the  impacts  of  home  computers  on  computer  skills. 

There  is  some  evidence  of  positive  impacts,  but  surprisingly  the  overall  evidence  is  not 

universally  strong.  For  example,  Fairlie  (2012)  finds  evidence  of  positive  effects  of  home 

computers on computer skills among college students, whereas Fairlie and Robinson (2013) find 

no evidence of home computers on computer knowledge or skills among schoolchildren. Among 

young  children  in  Peru,  Beuermann  et  al.  (2012)  find  strong  evidence  that  the  OLPC  laptops 

improved scores on a proficiency test in using the laptop, but find no effects on skills for using a 

Windows based computer or using the Internet. Mo et al. (2013) finds large positive effects on 

computer  skills  from  OLPC  laptops  for  young  children  in  China.  Finally,  Malamud  and  Pop-

Eleches (2010) find that  winning a computer vouchers increased computer knowledge, fluency 

and applications, but not web and email fluency among Romanian children. 

Research has also focused on the impacts of specific types of computer use or impacts on 

other  educational  or  social  outcomes.  For  example,  a  few  studies  have  explored  the  effects  of 

Facebook use among college students on academic outcomes and find mixed results (see Pasek 

and  Hargittai  2009,  Kirschner  and  Karpinski  2010,  and  Junco  2012  for  example). 

Bauernschuster,  Falck  and  Woessmann  (2014)  use  German  data  to  examine  the  effects  of 

broadband Internet access on childrens extra-curricular school activities such as sports, music, 

arts, and drama and do not find evidence of crowd out. Finally, Beuermann et al. (2012), using 

data from Perus randomization across and within schools, do not find evidence of spillovers to 

classmates and friends (though close friends appear to become more proficient at using a laptop). 

Summary 

44 

 
 
A few patterns emerge from the review of the empirical literature on home effects. First, 

studies  using  multivariate  regressions  and  instrumental  variable  models  tend  to  show  large 

positive (and in some cases negative) effects, but studies using randomized control experiments 

tend to show zero or small positive effects. As noted above, the contrast in findings may be due 

to  selection  bias.  Fairlie  and  London  (2012)  find  evidence  that  non-experimental  estimates  for 

community  college  students  are  nearly  an  order  of  magnitude  larger  than  the  experimental 

estimates.  Second,  most  studies  estimate  impacts  on  grades  and  test  scores,  but  many  studies 

examine  additional  outcomes  such  as  homework  time,  enrollment  and  graduation.  Although 

there  are  some  differences  in  results  across  outcomes  they  are  generally  consistent  within  the 

same study. The lack of consistent variation in findings for different outcome measures is at least 

a  little  surprising  because  we  might  expect  intermediate  inputs  such  as  homework  time  and 

grades  that  are  related  to  effort  to  be  affected  more  by  potential  crowd-out  or  efficiency  gains 

than test scores which capture the amount of information children learned during the school year. 

Although  not  the  focus  of  the  paper,  we  also  review  a  few  papers  examining  impacts  on 

computer  skills  and  find  some  evidence  of  positive  effects.  But  perhaps  these  findings  are  not 

surprising as there is no reason to suspect a negative influence. 

Most of the earlier research was on the United States and other developed countries, but 

several  recent  studies  examine  home  computer  impacts  in  developing  countries.  The  research 

focusing on developing countries tends to find smaller impacts, but it is difficult to disentangle 

this from their methodological focus on random experiments. Theoretically, the effects might be 

very  different  in  the  United  States  and  other  countries  with  a  greater  reliance  on  technology 

throughout the educational system. Finally, several studies explore heterogeneity in the effects of 

home computers on educational outcomes. Most of the studies examining heterogeneity focus on 

45 

 
 
 
main  demographic  groups  such  as  race  and  gender,  but  studies  also  examine  heterogeneity  by 

pre-treatment academic performance, parental supervision, and propensity for entertainment use 

of computers. The evidence on heterogeneity is decidedly mixed with no clear evidence even for 

the same group across studies. 

Overall, these results suggest that increasing access to home computers  among students 

who do not already have access is unlikely to greatly improve educational outcomes, but is also 

unlikely to negatively affect outcomes.

Another  approach,  first  taken  by  Schmidt  and  Wadsworth  (2006),  is  to  include  future 

computer  ownership  in  the  educational  outcome  regression.  A  positive  estimate  of  future 

computer  ownership  on  educational  attainment  would  raise  concerns  that  current  ownership 

proxies  for  an  unobserved  factor,  such  as  educational  motivation.  Future  computer  ownership, 

however,  is  not  found  to  have  a  positive  relationship  with  educational  outcomes  similar  to  the 

positive relationship found for contemporaneous computer ownership (Schmidt and Wadsworth 

2006 and Beltran, Das and Fairlie 2010). Along these lines of falsification tests or "pencil tests" 

(DiNardo  and  Pischke  1997),  Schmidt  and  Wadsworth  (2006)  do  not  find  evidence  that  other 

household  assets  which  proxy  for  wealth  such  as  dishwashers,  driers  and  cars  have  similar 

effects on educational attainment. Similarly, Beltran, Das and Fairlie (2008) do not find evidence 

of  a  positive  relationship  between  educational  attainment  and  having  a  dictionary  or  cable 

television  at  home,  which  also  might  be  correlated  with  unobserved  educational  motivation  or 

wealth. 

A  couple  of  studies  address  selection  concerns  by  estimating  fixed  effect  models.  The 

inclusion of student fixed effects controls for differences in unobservable characteristics that are 

time-invariant. Vigdor, Ladd and Martinez (2014), using panel data from North Carolina public 

schools, find modestly-sized negative effects of home computer access and local-area access to 

high-speed Internet connections on math and reading test scores when including fixed effects. In 

contrast, they find positive estimates when student fixed effects are excluded. Beltran, Das and 

39 

 
Fairlie (2010) find that adding student fixed effects results in smaller positive point estimates that 

lose significance. 

Malamud  and  Pop-Eleches  (2010)  address  the  endogeneity  problem  with  a  regression 

discontinuity  design  (RDD)  based  on  the  effects  of  a  government  program  in  Romania  that 

allocated  a  fixed  number  of  vouchers  for  computers  to  low-income  children  in  public  schools. 

The basic idea of the RDD is that schoolchildren just below the income threshold for eligibility 

for a computer voucher are compared to schoolchildren just above the income threshold. The two 

groups  of  schoolchildren  close  to  the  threshold  have  nearly  identical  characteristics  and  differ 

only in their eligibility for the computer voucher. Estimates from the discontinuity indicate that 

Romanian  children  winning  vouchers  have  lower  grades,  but  higher  cognitive  ability  as 

measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices. 

A  few  randomized  control  experiments  have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effects  of 

home computers on educational outcomes. The first random experiment involving the provision 

of  free  computers  to  students  for  home  use  was  Fairlie  and  London  (2012).  The  random-

assignment  evaluation  was  conducted  with  286  entering  students  receiving  financial  aid  at  a 

large  community  college  in  Northern  California.24  Half  of  the  participating  students  were 

randomly  selected  to  receive  free  computers.  After  two  years,  the  treatment  group  of  students 

who received  free  computers had modestly better  educational outcomes  than the  control  group 

along a few measures. Estimates for a summary index of educational outcomes indicate that the 

treatment group is 0.14 standard deviations higher than the control group mean. Students living 

farther  from  campus  and  students  who  have  jobs  appear  to  have  benefitted  more  from  the 

24 The focus on the impacts of computers on community college students is important, unlike four-year 
colleges where many students live on campus and have access to large computer labs, community college 
students often have limited access to on-campus technology.

flexibility  afforded by  home computers. The results from the  experiment also provide the only 

evidence in the literature on the effects of home computers for post-secondary students. 

Fairlie and Robinson (2013) also conduct a random experiment, but shift the focus from 

college  students  to  schoolchildren.  The  experiment  includes  1,123  students  in  grades  6-10 

attending  15  schools  across  California.  All  of  the  schoolchildren  participating  in  the  study  did 

not  have  computers  prior  to  the  experiment  and  half  were  randomly  selected  to  receive  free 

computers. The results indicate that even though there was a large effect on computer ownership 

and  total  hours  of  computer  use,  there  is  no  evidence  of  an  effect  on  a  host  of  educational 

outcomes, including grades, standardized test scores, credits earned, attendance, and disciplinary 

actions. No test score effects are found at the mean, at important cutoffs in the distribution (e.g. 

passing and proficiency), or at quantiles in the distribution. The estimates are precise enough to 

rule  out  even  moderately-sized  positive  or  negative  effects.  Consistent  with  these  results,  they 

find no evidence that treatment students spent more time on homework and that the computers 

had  an  effect  on  turning  homework  in  on  time,  software  use,  computer  knowledge,  or  other 

intermediate inputs in education. Treatment students report spending more time on computers for 

schoolwork,  but  they  also  report  spending  more  time  on  computers  playing  games,  social 

networking and for other entertainment. 

Most  of  the  evidence  in  the  literature  focuses  on  the  effects  of  home  computers  on  the 

educational  outcomes  of  schoolchildren  in  developed  or  transition  economies.  A  couple  of 

previous studies use random experiments to examine the impacts of one laptop per child (OLPC) 

laptops on educational outcomes in developing countries.25 Beuermann et al. (2012) examine the 

25 Although the One Laptop per Child program in Peru (Cristia et al. 2012) and the Texas laptop program 
(evaluated with a quasi-experiment in Texas Center for Educational Research 2009) were initially 
intended to allow students to take computers home when needed in addition to using them in school, this 
did not happen in most cases. In Peru, some principals, and even parents, did not allow the computers to

impacts of  randomly  providing  approximately 1,000  laptops for  home  use  to schoolchildren  in 

grades  1  through  6  in  Peru.26  They  find  that  the  laptops  have  a  positive,  but  small  and 

insignificant  effect  on  cognitive  skills  as  measured  by  the  Raven's  Progressive  Matrices  test 

(though  the  effect  is  significant  among  children  who  did  not  already  have  a  home  computer 

before  the  experiment).  Teachers  reported  that  the  effort  exerted  in  school  was  significantly 

lower  for  treatment  students  than  control  students  and  that  treated  children  reported  reading 

books,  stories  or  magazines  less  than  control  children.  Mo  et  al.  (2012)  randomly  distribute 

OLPC  laptops  to  roughly  half  of  a  sample  of  300  young  schoolchildren  (grade  3)  in  China.27 

They find some evidence that the laptops improved math test scores, but no evidence of effects 

on Chinese tests. They also find that the laptops increased learning activity use of computers and 

decreased time spent watching television. 

3.3.2 Heterogeneity in Home Computer Effects 

The effects of home computers on educational outcomes might differ across subgroups of 

the student population. For example, minority students might benefit more or less from having a 

home  computer  because  of  more  limited  opportunities  for  alternative  places  of  access,  social 

interactions with other computer users, and learning about use from parents, siblings and friends. 

Girls  and  boys  may  differ  in  how  they  use  computers  possibly  resulting  in  differential  effects. 

Several studies estimate separate home computer effects by demographic group and other student 

come home because of concerns that the laptops would not be replaced through the program if they were 
damaged or stolen. The result is that only 40 percent of students took the laptops home, and home use was 
substantially lower than in-school use. In Texas, there were similar concerns resulting in many schools 
not allowing computers to be taken home or restricting their home use. The main effect from these laptop 
programs is therefore to provide one computer for every student in the classroom, rather than to increase 
home access. 
26 Recipients of the laptops were also provided with an instruction manual and seven weekly training 
sessions. 
27 The laptops included some tutoring software and one training session was provided.

characteristics. For example, in Attewell and Battle's (1999) study of home computer effects on 

the test scores and grades of eighth graders they find evidence of stronger positive relationships 

between home computers and educational outcomes for higher SES children, boys, and whites. 

Fiorini's (2010) study of the impacts of home computer use on cognitive and non-cognitive skills 

among Australian children ages 4 to 7 finds evidence of larger effects for girls and children with 

less  educated  parents.  Fairlie  (2012)  finds  larger  effects  of  home  computers  on  educational 

outcomes for minority college students than non-minority college students. 

As  with  school-based  interventions,  the  evidence  is  mixed  with  several  studies  not 

finding evidence of heterogeneity in the effects of home computers. For example, Beltran, Das 

and  Fairlie  (2010)  estimate  regressions  that  include  interactions  between  home  computers  and 

race,  income  or  gender  and,  in  almost  all  cases,  do  not  find  statistically  significant  interaction 

effects.  Fairlie  and  Robinson  (2013)  and  Fairlie  (2015)  find  no  evidence  of  heterogeneous 

treatment  effects  by  pre-treatment  academic  achievement,  parental  supervision,  propensity  for 

non-game  use,  grade,  race,  or  gender.  Beuermann  et  al.  (2012)  find  some  evidence  of  a  larger 

reduction in school effort for younger Peruvian children, but essentially no difference in effects 

on  cognitive  skills  for  younger  children  and  no  difference  in  effects  on  school  effort  and 

cognitive  skills  by  gender.  In  their  study  of  Romanian  schoolchildren,  Malumud  and  Pop-

Eleches (2010) do  not  find evidence of differential effects  by  gender, but do find that  younger 

children  experience  larger  gains  in  cognitive  skills.  Given  the  lack  of  consistency  in  findings 

across studies for any subgroup, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions on this question. 

3.3.3 Effects on Computer Skills and Other Outcomes 

43 

 
 
Several  previous  studies  examine  the  impacts  of  home  computers  on  computer  skills. 

There  is  some  evidence  of  positive  impacts,  but  surprisingly  the  overall  evidence  is  not 

universally  strong.  For  example,  Fairlie  (2012)  finds  evidence  of  positive  effects  of  home 

computers on computer skills among college students, whereas Fairlie and Robinson (2013) find 

no evidence of home computers on computer knowledge or skills among schoolchildren. Among 

young  children  in  Peru,  Beuermann  et  al.  (2012)  find  strong  evidence  that  the  OLPC  laptops 

improved scores on a proficiency test in using the laptop, but find no effects on skills for using a 

Windows based computer or using the Internet. Mo et al. (2013) finds large positive effects on 

computer  skills  from  OLPC  laptops  for  young  children  in  China.  Finally,  Malamud  and  Pop-

Eleches (2010) find that  winning a computer vouchers increased computer knowledge, fluency 

and applications, but not web and email fluency among Romanian children. 

Research has also focused on the impacts of specific types of computer use or impacts on 

other  educational  or  social  outcomes.  For  example,  a  few  studies  have  explored  the  effects  of 

Facebook use among college students on academic outcomes and find mixed results (see Pasek 

and  Hargittai  2009,  Kirschner  and  Karpinski  2010,  and  Junco  2012  for  example). 

Bauernschuster,  Falck  and  Woessmann  (2014)  use  German  data  to  examine  the  effects  of 

broadband Internet access on childrens extra-curricular school activities such as sports, music, 

arts, and drama and do not find evidence of crowd out. Finally, Beuermann et al. (2012), using 

data from Perus randomization across and within schools, do not find evidence of spillovers to 

classmates and friends (though close friends appear to become more proficient at using a laptop). 

Summary 

44 

 
 
A few patterns emerge from the review of the empirical literature on home effects. First, 

studies  using  multivariate  regressions  and  instrumental  variable  models  tend  to  show  large 

positive (and in some cases negative) effects, but studies using randomized control experiments 

tend to show zero or small positive effects. As noted above, the contrast in findings may be due 

to  selection  bias.  Fairlie  and  London  (2012)  find  evidence  that  non-experimental  estimates  for 

community  college  students  are  nearly  an  order  of  magnitude  larger  than  the  experimental 

estimates.  Second,  most  studies  estimate  impacts  on  grades  and  test  scores,  but  many  studies 

examine  additional  outcomes  such  as  homework  time,  enrollment  and  graduation.  Although 

there  are  some  differences  in  results  across  outcomes  they  are  generally  consistent  within  the 

same study. The lack of consistent variation in findings for different outcome measures is at least 

a  little  surprising  because  we  might  expect  intermediate  inputs  such  as  homework  time  and 

grades  that  are  related  to  effort  to  be  affected  more  by  potential  crowd-out  or  efficiency  gains 

than test scores which capture the amount of information children learned during the school year. 

Although  not  the  focus  of  the  paper,  we  also  review  a  few  papers  examining  impacts  on 

computer  skills  and  find  some  evidence  of  positive  effects.  But  perhaps  these  findings  are  not 

surprising as there is no reason to suspect a negative influence. 

Most of the earlier research was on the United States and other developed countries, but 

several  recent  studies  examine  home  computer  impacts  in  developing  countries.  The  research 

focusing on developing countries tends to find smaller impacts, but it is difficult to disentangle 

this from their methodological focus on random experiments. Theoretically, the effects might be 

very  different  in  the  United  States  and  other  countries  with  a  greater  reliance  on  technology 

throughout the educational system. Finally, several studies explore heterogeneity in the effects of 

home computers on educational outcomes. Most of the studies examining heterogeneity focus on 

45 

 
 
 
main  demographic  groups  such  as  race  and  gender,  but  studies  also  examine  heterogeneity  by 

pre-treatment academic performance, parental supervision, and propensity for entertainment use 

of computers. The evidence on heterogeneity is decidedly mixed with no clear evidence even for 

the same group across studies. 

Overall, these results suggest that increasing access to home computers  among students 

who do not already have access is unlikely to greatly improve educational outcomes, but is also 

unlikely to negatively affect outcomes. 

4. Conclusions 

Theoretically, the net effects of ICT investments in schools, the use of CAI in schools, and the 

use  of  computers  at  home  on  educational  outcomes  are  ambiguous.  Expenditures  and  time 

devoted to using computers, software, the Internet and other technologies may be more efficient 

than  expenditures  on  other  educational  inputs  or  may  be  less  efficient.  New  technologies  may 

displace other more effective instructional and learning methods and distract schoolchildren, or 

they may represent an effective learning tool and engage schoolchildren in learning. Thus, it is 

perhaps  not  surprising  that  the  findings  from  the  rapidly  growing  empirical  literature  on  the 

effects of computers, the Internet and computer assisted instruction are mixed. 

The implications from these findings suggest that we should not expect large positive (or 

negative) impacts from ICT investments in schools or computers at home. Schools should not 

expect major improvements in grades, test scores and other measures of academic outcomes 

from investments in ICT or adopting CAI in classrooms, though there might be exceptions such 

as some CAI interventions in developing countries. Existing and proposed interventions to 

bridge the digital divide in the United States and other countries, such as large-scale voucher 

46 

 
 
 
programs, tax breaks for educational purchases of computers, and one-to-one laptop programs 

with check-out privileges are unlikely to substantially reduce the achievement gap on their own. 

An important caveat to this tempered conclusion, however, is that there might be other 

educational effects of having a computer that are not captured in measurable academic outcomes. 

For example, computers may be useful for finding information about colleges and financial aid. 

They might be useful for communicating with teachers and schools and parental supervision of 

student performance, attendance and disciplinary actions through the spreading use of student 

information system software (e.g. School Loop, Zangle, ParentConnect, and Aspen). Similar to 

other aspects of society, schools, professors and financial aid sources are rapidly expanding their 

use of technology to provide information and course content to students. A better understanding 

of these potential benefits is important for future research. 

More  research  is  clearly  needed  in  additional  areas.  First,  more  research  is  needed  on 

benefit-cost analyses of  computers,  Internet connections, software,  and  other technologies with 

attention devoted to whether expenditures on these interventions are substituting for other inputs 

or  represent  new  expenditures.  The  cost  of  various  interventions  is  rarely  documented  or 

considered.  Though  purchase  costs  are  declining,  maintenance  costs  may  be  high  and  devices 

may become obsolete or need to be replaced frequently. Second, more research is needed on the 

shape  of  the  educational  returns  to  technology.  For  example,  are  the  marginal  benefits  from  a 

few hours of computer use in the classroom high, but then decline rapidly when computers are 

used more extensively in the classroom? Third, more research is needed on the related question 

of  online  education.  There  is  considerable  momentum  towards  offering  online  courses  by 

colleges,  massive  open  online  courses  (MOOCs),  creation  of  online  colleges,  and  flipped 

classrooms, but we know relatively little about their effectiveness relative to costs. Fourth, more 

47 

 
 
research is needed on the impacts of specific uses of computers. For example, computer use for 

researching topics might be beneficial, whereas computer use for practicing skills may displace 

other more productive forms of learning (Falck, Mang and Woessmann 2015). Each new use of 

computer technology poses new possible benefits in terms of customization and flexibility, but 

also  creates  potential  pitfalls  that  may  interfere  with  education.28  One  of  the  fundamental 

challenges  of  studying  the  effects  of  computer  technology  on  educational  outcomes  is  that 

research  consensus  often  lags  the  implementation  of  new  initiatives.  Computer  technology  is 

expanding  rapidly  from  desktop  computers  to  laptops  iPads  and  phones,  and  from  educational 

software to Internet learning applications and social media.  

28 See Los Angeles Unified School Districts one-to-one iPad program for a high profile example of the 
challenges of adopting new and relatively untested technology. Several schools attempted to abandon the 
program after students by-passed security filters in order to access the Internet, which was not intended. 
The program was suspended in light of possible flaws in the bidding process for technology provision.

Note: To create the measure of computers per student, PISA uses 
responses to the following two questions: "At your school, what is the 
total number of students in the <national modal grade for 15-year-
olds>?," and "Approximately, how many computers are available for 
these students for educational purposes?"
